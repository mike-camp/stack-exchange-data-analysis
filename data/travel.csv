right-of-way - merging vs. oncoming traffic in Pennsylvania,"As depicted in the Google satellite image below, I (red) was merging onto the southbound lane of Route 89. At the yield sign (at location of the red dot) I observed that there were no approaching cars in the southbound lane. However, there was a car (blue) in the northbound lane who had their turn signal on to turn left into the Cafe parking lot. I did not see my interaction with this vehicle to be any different than if I had already been on Route 89 and I proceeded without stopping.
However, based on the blue vehicles actions, it is clear that they thought that I should have stopped at the yield sign and allowed them to turn in front of me. 
Who had the right of way in this instance?

Note that projected paths are dotted and already traveled paths are solid in the above image.
The location is rural Pennsylvania.
I should note that I understand the importance of defensive driving and being ready and aware of what others actually do, even if it is not in line with the rules. I'm simply trying to understand what the rule is in this situation. Who actually has the right-of way here and who ""should"" be yielding?

Bringing coins back home from abroad; Is that unethical to do?,"I have a bad habit of not properly utilizing foreign currency coins when I tour any country. When I pay in bills and get back coins I don't know why my brain is programmed to think of them as change and for the next purchase I would again use a new bill.
Sometimes it is also due to the fact that I don't like to spend a long time on a counter trying to count coins up to a certain amount so just to make it easy for me I would just pay with a currency note that's slightly bigger than the required amount, or use a combination etc. It is also due to the fact that sometimes its hard to get used to the denominations specially for coins on a short trip; they sure do some in various shapes and sizes, whereas on for paperback it is comparatively easier.
I usually bring all those coins back home, they are quite a bunch of them by the end of a trip. I bring them home as a memory or as something that relates to my trip for a long time to come. I am not a coin collector but sometimes when I see that this coin that I have is from a country which i visited when i was a child it makes me feel good. Sometimes my family members take some of them as souvenirs.
The only time I use those coins abroad is on vending machines and lately in theme parks for my kid on toys which operate with coins.
Lately I have been reading about this fairly global practice that all coins should either be used at the airport or given to homeless people in that country before you fly out.
That has got me wondering whether what I do is unethical? I am not a miser nor do I have any use for those coins when I reach home but even when I find a homeless person abroad I give them a currency note instead of a coin.
Is this a bad practice?

If you use wifi while onboard for free (not paying) is it illegal?,"There is a ""loophole""(?) for using wifi onboard an airplane without paying for it. Or perhaps not a loophole, rather an unadvertised but 'legal' pathway to access onboard wifi services that Google has negotiated for its users. If you are using a product from the Google suite of services (gmail, google analytics, Google Chat...etc) the access is provided without charge. The argument that came up was that this activity was illegal as it was not specifically mentioned in the T&C's of the onboard wifi access as being allowed. Is it illegal to access wifi onboard without paying for it if the airline offers wifi as a fee for service option to travellers?

How to obtain a multiple entry Schengen visa from USA for a Russian citizen?,"Russian citizen, permanent resident of the US, lives in US and travels to Russia 3-4 times a year for about a week or two.

At present, she applied and received multiple short-term Schengen visas from Finland, Sweden, Iceland, France and Germany (about 5 total). However, despite her requests the visa was always granted in the C-1 category (30 days validity) single or double entry. Visa process is very time-consuming (collecting all the paperwork) and has to be planned many month in advance (waiting line for German consulate is 1 1/2 month as of today). She, to the best of my knowledge, has always complied with the visa requirements, has reasonably well paying job (>$100K) in the US and some property in the US. However, each and every time the visa granted is C-1 with 1 month validity and with the duration of stay for exact duration of transit +1 day.

travel from Gothenburg C to Copenhagen airport (CPH),"I have a return flight to Canada from the Copenhagen airport (CPH) at 12:35pm on July 1st, 2017 and am currently staying in Gothenburg. I have booked a ticket with Öresundståg departing from Gothenburg Central Station at 6:55am on July 1st and arriving at the Copenhagen airport at 10:13am on July 1st. If everything goes according to plan, I will have enough time to check-in my return flight and board the plane.
I know that there is currently border control by Sweden for trains entering Sweden from Denmark.
Q1) If I am entering Denmark from Sweden, is there any similar border control at any point during the trip that would make the duration of the train ride longer?
The Öresundståg website says that

Traveling from Sweden to Denmark
When traveling from Sweden to Denmark there are no border or ID
  controls. The trains run according to schedule, with the exception of
  the reduction to one departure every 20 minutes even during peak
  hours.

Q2) Is this really accurate? 
Q3) If there is indeed a border control for train rides from Sweden to Denmark, how much time should I expect it to add to the trip?
I noticed today on the Öresundståg website a notice saying

Disruptions in traffic between Halmstad and Falkenberg 2017-06-29

  will increase.

2) Is this a temporary notice, only applicable to the day June 29, 2017 (i.e., today)? Or should I expect that my train on July 1, 2017 will also be delayed?
In short, my concern is to arrive on time at the Copenhagen airport to be able to catch my flight back to Canada. There are buses that will leave Gothenburg Central Station, but will arrive way too early at the airport. I prefer the train but am a bit worried about unexpected delays (or expected ones) during the train ride.

Walking 14 km on a pilgrimage road where footwear may be considered disrespectful,"There's this 14 km long road that's one of the main attractions in Thiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu, India. The road goes all the way around a small mountain called Arunachala. The mountain is considered holy. The road is a road for pilgrims. They walk around the mountain as an act of worship. The whole road around the mountain (almost all 14 km of it) is considered a sort of holy site. The path is like this:

Here are pilgrims walking around the mountain.

There are millions of pilgrims walking around this mountain every year. I've never seen any of them wearing footwear of any kind. There is the paved road, and there is asphalt on the side. The pilgrims walk barefoot on both. The whole road around the mountain is considered holy, similarly to a temple. Wearing footwear in a Hindu temple is considered a serious offense.
Now, I want to join the pilgrims and walk this 14 km road. But I have never walked such a distance barefoot before. It's hard concrete/tiles/asphalt.
How will it be received by the pilgrims and locals if someone walks with some type of footwear on such a road?  How bad is it compared to walking with footwear into a temple (the latter being totally unacceptable.)
Has anyone here tried walking such a long distance barefoot on stone? Should I just go for it?
I guess if the pilgrims can do it, then so can I! I think I'll just go barefoot. But maybe I can get some helpful advice here.

Can I dispute late cancellation fee with the hotel?,"I tried to book a hotel for someone for work, the same hotel I used last time for the same guest. Last time they did not ask me to fill out credit card authorisation form and now they insisted on it. They sent me credit card authorization form to complete and as I started filling it out I started to question myself why should I give business to someone who is treating me like that and decided to go with another hotel. I did not contact them again and assumed that reservation was never made since I did not get any e-mail or call stating that reservation was complete (usually in my experience hotels send reservation details right after you reserve it). So I found another hotel with a friendly staff and made a reservation. 
On the day of the trip I got a call from this hotel asking when I will send in credit card authorisation form. 
It was early in the morning so by mistake I said that I completed it thinking that it was the hotel with whom I booked the trip then I told them I will check my records and will call them back. Later I sent an e-mail stating that I went with another hotel. Then they replied saying that they will charge me for one night because of the late cancellation of the reservation.

My family is flying Lisbon->Istambul->Manila with a transit stop in Ataturk Airport at the end of the month of October. A single ticket covers both legs of the flight.
Turkish airlines just sent a message today, an email in Turkish (God knows why - they speak English), and two SMSes in English telling them their last leg departure was brought forward by 30 minutes.
The point is that they bought that flight because they had 2h20m to do transit, and now they only have 1h50m or less (minus the standard 15 minutes delay for Economy class?), so they should have now 1h35m to change connecting flights.
It is the first time they will be navigating that particular airport. 
While the  last question states it is possible to do it; my question is a bit different; what steps do they have to take to minimize the problems, and not for instance going by a route different from the transit one? Is Ataturk easy to navigate, and has it plenty of English signs? Any advice on the route to take inside the airport?

How to obtain a Schengen visa after being denied entry to Germany with a visa issued by Spain?,"I am from Vietnam.
I had a Schengen visa with multiple entries from 2 July 2016 to 2 July 2017 issued by Spanish Embassy. 
My daughter (15 years old) had a Schengen visa with one entry from 25 January 2017 to 4 February 2017 issued by Spanish Embassy. I did it for her. 
We flied to Germany with these visas on 25 January 2017, and both of us were denied to enter Germany due to visa misuse at Frankfurt Airport. They put big 'denied' stamps on our visas.
After research about this issue, I understand that I was wrong to think that with a Schengen visa, I could go to any countries in Europe. I understand now if I would want to go only to Germany, I should apply for a Schengen visa issued by German Embassy.
I understand that even I knew I would have no problem to apply for a Schengen visa via German Consulate. But I thought it would take time for my daughter to get it in such a short timing that she can go with me to Berlin for this Lunar New Year. That's why I did the visa via Spain which was much quicker. Now I've found out that I was totally wrong. 
I understand that the incident has been recorded in the SIS, and it would create a very difficult situation for me to apply for another Schengen visa.
I have a clear intention to apply for a Schengen visa through German Embassy.
I have very good and clean history of travel and financial situation:

Current visas I've had:

Multiple entries to Canada till 2025
Multiple entries to UK till 2021
Multiple entries to US renewal every one year
APEC business travel card (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) till 2021.

Old visa:

A number of Schengen visas issued by French Consulate (in 2011), Spanish Consulate (in 2015, 2016 from one entry to multiple entries in three months, then multiple entries in one year)
I studied in Australia 2004-2006.

Financial cover: 

I have employment for a indefinite term with a managerial position in a Spanish corporation.
Good financial statements to cover all requirements if it's needed

Invitation to Germany: My German boyfriend will do anything needed to submit to German Embassy for my visa application. He has his own business, and quite strong on his position.

My questions are:

How much difficulties when I apply a visa to Germany under my current circumstance?
What would be the procedure to clear my issue regarding the declining my Spanish visa at Germany border?
Is there any tolerance for my visa application that I would strong show how much I have been regret for the mistake, and would like to fix it immediately. 

I've been very depressed about this issue. I put my daughter in a very bad situation, and did a very bad role model into her early stage of growing up as an adult. 
I would like to show her that people make mistakes. There are mistakes can be fixed, and can't be fixed. This issue is hope to be fixed with positive attitude and the willingness to be a good person. That's why I wonder how much the tolerance in the SIS would grant to us.

Legality of Driving a Motorcyle in Vietnam as a Foreigner,"Motor scooters and mopeds are the main form of transport in Vietnam. They can be seen everywhere from the smallest alley in a city to remote mountain villages. As such, many tourists choose to adopt a ""when in Rome"" policy and hire or buy a scooter and travel the country on it.
What isn't at all clear, is what the legality of this is. The internet is confused on the matter, with google prefering to link to deleted posts on TripAdvisor forums (although the follow up comments would indicate that no, it isn't legal unless you prepare for (and pass) a Vietnamese test. My Lonely Planet guidebook indicates similar. Other sources say it is possible to get a Vietnamese license after presenting a foreign license and appropriate credentials to the proper government body. Some blogs and tour companies claim ""of course it's legal, don't be silly"" but provide no explanation or evidence for this. About the only thing that seems widely agreed is that the IDP is not accepted in Vietnam (although Wikipedia disputes even this).
As for why this should concern a traveller, when the behaviour (tourists driving scooters) seems broadly tolerated: it is always possible that the government will choose to change policy on enforcement. Moreover, if the activity is illegal, and the traveller is either seriously injured or accrues some legal liability, it is likely that insurance will refuse to pay out.
Bonus points if the answer covers cars as well (although car rental doesn't appear to be widely available)
References or indications of the law(s) relevant would be appreciated, as would any update on the state of IDPs (apparently changing) in Vietnam.

Can I get an e-Visa for Turkey with a Schengen visa for an earlier date than the Schengen visa?,"My case: I am an Egyptian national and my age is between 20 and 45 years. I have a Schengen visa valid from 6 July till 1 Jan. 
Question: Can I use it to obtain an e-visa to enter Turkey on 2 July? Is my Schengen visa considered ""valid"" when entering Turkey?
Details: According to the website of the Turkish ministry for Foreign Affairs for Egyptian nationals:

Egypt: Official passport holders are exempted from visa for their travels up to 90 days.
  Ordinary passport holders are required to have visa to enter Turkey. Ordinary passport holders may obtain their 30-day single-entry e-Visas via www.evisa.gov.tr, provided that they have a valid Schengen or USA, UK, Ireland visa or residence permit and that they travel to Turkey with Turkish Airlines or Egypt Air.
Besides, those ordinary passport holders who are under 20 or over 45 years old may get their 30-day single-entry e-Visas via the website www.evisa.gov.tr.

So I need to apply for an e-visa at https://www.evisa.gov.tr. 
When I go through the questions there, under the prerequisites listed for ordinary passport holders it says:

I am below 20 or over 45 years old; or I have a valid Supporting Document (Valid visa OR valid residence permit from one of the Schengen Countries, USA, UK or Ireland). E-visas are not accepted as supporting documents.

Which is unclear to me regarding whether my Schengen visa is considered ""valid"" when travelling before the dates on the Schengen visa.

Do you have to clear Moroccan immigration at any point flying Zurich-Casablanca-(Tanger)-Gibraltar?,"I'm considering buying a ticket Zurich-Gibraltar with Royal Air Maroc in a single multi-city booking (a normal booking cannot be made on that route), and with hand luggage only. I would check in online and get both boarding passes in Zurich.
The proposed trip consists of flight AT 937 Zurich-Casablanca, and flight AT 990 Casablanca-(Tanger)-Gibraltar, with Tanger being a technical stop, where however passengers can get on and off.
AT 937 arrives at terminal 2 in Casablanca, while AT 990 leaves from terminal 1. According to Timatic, the database used by airlines, airside transit is possible between the two.
My question is: would I have to clear Moroccan immigration at any point during this journey, given that AT 990 has a domestic leg?
I've already contacted Royal Air Maroc and received different answers. Some say you enter Morocco in Casablanca, get off the Gibraltar flight in Tanger, exit Morocco and re-board the flight. Others say you remain airside in Casablanca, and that those only flying the domestic leg still clear Moroccan immigration at Casablanca and Tanger due to the nature of the route.
Which is correct?

I have no connections . Unless she wants to renew it ) But then I was adviced the reason for asylum application is on human rights ground.
Anyway I was refused and then I applied to go back voluntarily which was accepted and I returned back to India voluntarily . I do not have any deportation stamp . But on my arrival i was interrogated about why I did apply for asylum and stuff which in return I had mentioned the above . So they had scanned my passport and let me go after making am wait in the group for couple of hours as there were crowd with Indian immigration officers . 
I did travel in the mean time to south Asian country where you get on arrival visa . And I had returned well before my visa expiry date mentioned in my passport of the last renewal . 
Now I am planning to apply for my study visa to Ireland . I am afraid will my past immigration history will show up ?! Or not as I have a new passport now .

The stamp just says I have arrived in India with a blue round deal with a red date on it . 
As I am planning to apply for Irish student visa for my research masters . I wonder will they have access to look into the details that i have applied for asylum or just will they notice that I had returned back on such n such date?! 
Or will they ask the uk embassy for information ?about my past? Even if they know the reason why I had applied for asylum which I had mentioned to indian officials will they reject it or will they accept my application and grant visa ? If they gonna ask me I would say the same truth I had mentioned to Indian officials on my return for the reasons to apply asylum in the U.K. . Will they grant it ? Or is there chance for refusal ?  I have no criminal convictions whatsoever till date back in the U.K. Or in India !! I could provide the ACRO UK certificate . 
Insights and informations please .
Thanking you

Can I apply for multiple visa?,"I got an offer from an UK employer which required me to apply for exempt VISA for 3 years, at that time the offer looked really cool but just before few days I got another offer from Germany which is sponsoring Blue Card visa for me which seems better than exempt visa. 
I am confused because I have already submitted my passport for the exempt VISA processing, is there any way I can proceed with Blue Card visa after I get my passport back with exempt visa?

"When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?","Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. 
While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?

A border services officer at the port of entry in Canada will determine how long you can stay in Canada. Most visitors are allowed a six-month stay from the day they entered Canada. If the officer authorizes a stay of less than six months, they will indicate in your passport the date by which you must leave Canada. 

Would anyone happen to know what circumstances would arise that I'm only allowed the 4 months? I know my home university won't be regulating my stay, and neither will UQAM.

Flight booked through Expedia transit issue,"I recently booked a two way flight through Expedia. The flight is from country A to B, both of which I can enter with no problem. Each of the flights has connections. In my first flight I connected in Amsterdam. This went smoothly. In my way back, I had a connection in the US. When I wanted to check in I was told that transits in the USA requires a visa. I tried contacting Expedia while at the airport with no result. I ended up going to the airline ticketing desk and changing my reservation to avoid US. Of course I had to pay about $800 for this change.
Later, I called Expedia and and after good hold time I was able to talk to a supervisor. She told me that I'm responsible to have proper travel documents, I said that I take fully responsibility for my initial and final destinations, but they should take responsibility for the connections as they suggested it.
My question is, am eligible for a compensation? Is it possible to be compensated?
Update: I completely agree that, legally speaking, Expedia is covered. However, from a good business practice perspective, it seems to me that it is a serious flaw to book a flight through a country, outside the traveller's origin and destination, without clearly indicating such possibility. What, for example, if I didn't have money to change my reservation? Many scenarios can go horribly wrong when you thousands of kilometers away from home.

However, I still have a F1 visa valid till 2018 from my previous program (different university, same SEVIS) so I was wondering if I could just withdraw my application, get my passport back and fly on that visa? Would this create any problems for me in the future? Or maybe the Embassy canceled my old visa when I submitted it?

Sleeping options when under 18 and travelling solo,"I'm a 16 year old citizen of Ukraine, living in Poland, and I want to travel to Lofoten, northern Norway, by hitchhiking from Warsaw. One of the adventure's goals is to spend as little money as possible. And when it comes to where to sleep, problems begin, because I'm not allowed to use couchsurfing etc. because I'm under 18. It's okay for me to sleep in a tent and a sleeping bag, but it would be nice to stay at someone's home from time to time to take a proper shower, to cook something in the kitchen and to sleep beneath the roof.
One option I thought of is for my father to create an account for me. Then maybe I can use it, just to see where there are houses with couchsurfing hosts in the nearest city, go there ask them whether they'll let me to stay for a night. Would I be able to do this without a problem?
Also, I have a type D visa allowing me to be in any Schengen country for less than 90 days.
Edit:
I see, that i have forgotten to mention some details, so it led to a lot of misunderstanding regarding my situation.
I live in Poland with my family, and no, I am not going to just run away from home for this trip :D. No, I'll of course inform my parents about the trip and I'll have written permission from them to travel (i even already have one :). I will take my card which is connected to my father's account and some cash to by food etc. My parents will provide me with some money, they can even pay for me staying in hostel every night, that's not the problem - i just want my trip to be something like this. I have already read about right to roam and i know basic hitchhiking rules.
Also, in my plan about using father's couchsurfing account, i don't want to ""book"" houses or make any contact through the system, no. I'm just wondering wether there is a ""map"" on this website that allows users to see where there are couchsurfing hosts in particular city with their exact adresses given, so that i can go there by feet, knock the door, and if the host would be there, ask him wether he'll let me stay for one night (menitoning that i'm 16). This would be better than just asking people in random houses, because on couchsurfing i can see wether person is good (reference system) and if i just knock random door there might be paedophile living etc.
Also, camping sites and hostels with €20 per night are not really the best option for me, because that would cost a little bit, considering the fact that my trip would take me approx one month, and that i don't want to spend a lot of money.
I was asking about some free options like ""search for houses with families or grandparents and ask them wether they'll let you stay for a night in their garage and use their shower"".
P.S.: are there free public showers on my way (Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway)?

"I've applied for a UK Standard Visitor visa to attend to my sick husband, but my application was refused. How should I reapply?","I have applied for a UK visitor visa to see my sick husband (who has ILR) in the hospital. It was my very first application ever, as I never intended to go to the UK until I finish my mandatory housemanship/internship training. 
I urgently applied after my husband fell ill so suddenly, without thinking a lot about it and, ten days later, it got refused. I'm reapplying again, after correcting what went wrong the last time. 
I am also making a human rights claim in my application this time around because I think I qualify for one. My husband of 2 years is bedridden in hospital so going there is the ONLY option. I cannot even talk to him on the phone because he has had brain surgery.
I am attaching pictures of the refusal notice. Do I have a chance this time after submitting all the right documents? 
My bank statement does show regular flow of income but it's empty at the moment. As a junior doctor who is still training I get very little pay, my husband is my provider. I am being sponsored by my sister-in-law and her husband, both of whom are British citizens. 
My questions are:

Will an empty bank account adversely affect my application the next time despite the 3rd part sponsorship?
Will a frank human rights claim attract more consideration from the ECO? To at least refer the case to the ECM or grant me the right to appeal in case refused?
They previously stated I had limited evidence of my circumstances. Although I attached a letter from my mother stating that I'm the eldest of 5. Mom is a widow. But now I am attaching copies of my siblings' passports, 2 property deeds. I co-own the house we're living in with mom and siblings and I also have inherited another house that was owned by my father. In addition to my very important work, do these constitute what they consider ""strong ties to home country""?

So in addition to getting all the translations done, this is what I'm attaching this time:

My bank statement (showing an opening balance of about 850£, regular salaries and withdrawals over 6 months, closing balance of 10£).
My employment letter (showing no objection to leave with dates/ stating I need to come back and make for the absence).
Letter of internship from federal ministry of health.
Letter from Sudan Medical Council showing I have preliminary registration with my reg. Number and that I will be granted full reg after completing internship. 
University certificate of graduation.
Letter from the money exchange agency stating that my husband has been sending me monthly allowance from 1st receipt to last receipt. 
Property deeds (one of which I co-own with siblings and mom, other one is inheritance).
Father's death certificate. 
Copies of mother's and siblings' passports. 
Letter from my mother saying I help her with my younger siblings both financially and emotionally and that she wants me to become a fully registered doctor and pursue my career (something I will NEVER be able to do if I go underground in UK).
My own cover letter explaining my circumstances and list of documents. 
My marriage certificate. 
Photographs of myself, my husband, my sister-in-law and her husband on family occasions.
Letter of sponsorship (updated)
Passport copy of my sponsor.
Bank statements of sponsor's spouse.
Legal affidavit from my sister-in-law clarifying our relationship, and that she is taking care of her mother, and that she will take care of her brother after I leave.
Letter from the hospital where my husband is at (2 actually the older one and a newer one from a different hospital as they've moved him).
Husband's immigration status document.

Will these documents make my application stronger this time?

Does being refused entry to Singapore mean I am now blacklisted?,"My friend who is an Indonesian citizen tried to enter Singapore this week and was refused entry at the Singapore Harbour Front Ferry Terminal by immigration.
This was his first trip overseas and is not used to international travel, so due to his inexperience and that he was excited to go to Singapore, he possibly made some mistakes on trying to be granted access into Singapore. 
He was told he was to enter a Singapore address for his stay or a friend or relative he will stay with. He was only staying for one day and was going to catch the ferry back at night, so he had no plan to stay in Singapore and as such had no address to put. They then asked why he was traveling alone and that he should travel with somebody for his first trip. He told them he always travels alone in Indonesia and finds it easier to see and do things alone. He was then asked why he was entering Singapore and the reason he gave was to purchase some electronics which he cannot buy in Indonesia. They asked for how much money he had and they then advised that he did not have enough money to purchase the items he was after. They refused his entry and he was then escorted to a ferry and returned to Indonesia. His passport was not stamped and he was not fingerprinted. 
He was given a Notice of Refusal of Entry which had the reason as ""Being ineligible for the issue of a pass under current immigration policies"" form on his departure. Also included on this form is his passport number etc. He was not advised of him being banned or a time frame that he cannot enter Singapore.
My questions are:
Has he been banned or restricted to enter Singapore for a period of time?
When entering countries including Singapore, does he need to tick the box stating he has been refused entry into another country?

Is the 180 days in a year UK non-rule (myth) a hidden/unwritten rule?,"The myth of the 180 day non-rule has been debunked here on travelexchange however there is no explanation if it is perhaps an unwritten one.
We find that there are many rules and hidden requirements including funds parking and provenance of funds in granting UK visitor visas which are not explicitly spelled out. We also know that there is nothing explicit in the rules that say a visitor cannot spend more than 180 days in the previous one year in the UK.
The rules do say:

V 4.2 The applicant must satisfy the decision maker that they are a
  genuine visitor. This means that the applicant:
(b) will not live in the UK for extended periods through frequent or
  successive visits, or make the UK their main home;

Is the 180 day non-rule actually a defacto hidden rule and viewed as a violation of the above? In an article about the detention and denied landing of an Australian man to the UK, it explains the reason for his refusal as:

As a regular visitor to his family in Britain, he had already spent
  180 days in the UK in the previous 12 months, and was classified as
  having overstayed his visa.

No stamp on non-EU passport while travelling from Belfast to Dublin,"I am an Irish citizen, along with my whole family. 
My in-laws are non-EU citizens. They travelled to the UK on a visit visa while they applied for an Irish visit visa in their home country. During their stay in the UK, their Irish visa was approved. After facilitation through the Department of Justice visa section, they got their visa at the Irish Embassy London. 
Two days later, they came to Ireland via cheap budget flight, landing at Belfast airport because they wanted to see Belfast, as well. Then, we travelled via road in my Irish registered car to Dublin. They stayed two weeks and flew back to the UK via Ryan. 
In this whole process their passports were never stamped.  In fact, apart from their airline tickets, there is no evidence they had travelled to Ireland. They applied for another Irish visit visa. They wrote in their visa application that they did travel to Ireland, but the visa section is asking for proof of the stamp for that visit. How can we explain that there is no border control so no stamp was put in?
Was their entry illegal even though they had valid visas for both the UK and Ireland? Should we have done something differently?

Can I use a FIFA FAN ID to enter and leave Russia for tourism purposes?,"I am currently in Russia on a 90-day student visa that expires in September. I have tickets to attend the FIFA Confederations Cup 2017 final match on July 2nd. Attending this event requires registering for a FIFA FAN ID, which gives access to the stadium. According to the FIFA FAN ID FAQ:

FAN IDs are issued to all spectators of the FIFA Confederations Cup
  2017 for access to a stadium. FAN ID gives the opportunity to use free
  transport services on the match days in the host city the sports
  events. The foreign citizens, who come to the Russian Federation as
  spectators of the FIFA Confederations Cup 2017 matches, can use their
  FAN IDs for multiple visa-free entry into and exit from the Russian
  Federation upon presentation of valid identity documents that are
  recognized as such by the Russian Federation, during the period that
  starts ten days before the date of the first match and ends ten days
  after the date of the last match of the FIFA Confederations Cup 2017.

Considering the above, would it be legal for me to leave and re-enter Russia for tourism purposes (e.g. visit Finland or Estonia) by using my FIFA FAN ID? 
It seems to me that the intended use of this feature of the FIFA FAN IDs is for travelers to enter Russia for the purpose of watching the FIFA Cup, not for visa-holders like myself to leave for tourism purposes.
Lastly, even if this is technically legal, is it a good idea? I'd be interested in hearing the pros and cons of such travel.

"Is there a way to fast-track a ""Subject Access Request (SAR)"" in the EU?","Sometimes a person wants to find out what information a member state is keeping on them.  They may be contemplating a visa application, or a judicial review, or visiting one or more member states and they want to know if they will expect problems at the border control point.  I suppose in other cases some people are worried that an EU member might have obtained information that is inaccurate and they want to dispute the information.
The standard way to do this is with a ""Subject Access Request (SAR)"", we always tell people to do this following either a removal or refusal, especially if the information affects if the person can visit again or not.  The SAR is built-in to EU regulations to provide a remedy to learn what information a particular government has on them.
All well and good, but there are some member states (the UK) where the process can take hellishly long times.  Most people like to use a 8 - 12 month horizon for planning their travel, but if an SAR is going to take 18 - 24 months, then its value becomes worthless.
Or consider the case of a person filling out a visa application and they genuinely cannot remember their travel history, so they file an SAR and wait, but the process takes so long that they miss the reason they wanted the visa in the fist instance.
So the obvious question arises: is there a way to fast-track an SAR?  UKVI, for example, has several rungs of premium services where a visa application can be accelerated, even down to an hour.  What is the counterpart to an SAR application?  Is there an additional fee?

What rights to photography exist at UK airports?,"Recently while flying into the UK at Stansted Airport, I took a picture of a sign in the arrivals area pre-customs clearance. (The context is that when I travel, I like to take pictures of signs that I find amusing. Weird hobby, I know.)
This act was noticed by a member of staff - not someone from airport security or police, but someone assisting a wheelchair-bound traveller - who chased after me and asked me to delete the image since ""photography was not allowed within the airport"". She even ensured it was deleted from the phone's ""deleted images"" folder to prevent recovery. 
I complied at the time with this request since it was late and I didn't want an argument but it got me thinking: what photography rights do people legally have, without prior media clearance, at UK airports? And if yes, is this restricted to certain areas before/after security and customs clearance?

"How much cheaper are train tickets when buying in advance (UK, Manchester)?","It's always been said that the only way to make British trains affordable is to buy months in advance like you're taking an aeroplane.
Certainly on past experience coming on the day and buying a ticket it can be crazy expensive.
However; I suspect I may have been conned. Buying a ticket from the ticket desk and being given some very flexible any-time ticket rather than just a normal ticket for the next train.
Next month I have a flight to Manchester airport and then from here I need to get to the north east (Durham/Chester le Street/Newcastle, all good, I'm going to be picked up from the station to go onto my destination).
I've done something similar before and I remember buying a ticket for some hours after my flight and having to sit and wait at the airport station for a while whilst trains came and went to Manchester city. I don't want to buy one too close to my estimated landing time in case the flight is delayed.
How do I find out how much a ticket bought on the day will cost me?
Is there a way to balance buying in advance with the flexibility needed from connecting from a flight?

Border control missmarked my passport so it looks like I overstayed a day,"My wife has been working in Swaziland for the last year and she's getting ready to come back to the US. She just found that her passport was mis-stamped on her last South Africa–Swaziland crossing: the border agent mistakenly gave her only 7 days (apparently they missed her work permit or something, I wasn't there). She didn't notice that it was off until just now; she's now a day over the 7 days and one day from her flight home.
At the moment she's labeled (apparently) as ""undesirable"" and can't re-enter South Africa for a year, at least until she appeals this. She has 10 days to file paperwork for that. She will do that, of course, because she'll want to travel there again. But the concern at the moment is being able to get home. Will they let her connect through Swaziland on her trip back to the US? There is only one airport in the country and it flies only to Joberg, and the country is bordered on three sides by South Africa (and on the other by rural Mozambique... which I guess is a last-ditch possibility.)
Edit: I now have the ""DECLARATION OF FOREIGNER AS AN UNDESIRABLE PERSON"" form. It matches what I said above: all but ""(h) You have overstayed by 1 days, at a time."" and ""(i) Your undesirability status will be lifted and will expire on 24/06/2018 (DD/MM/YYYY), at which date you will only be allowed to re-enter the Republic."" are struck out.
Fortunately the appeals can apparently be emailed. But I'm sure they can't process them in a day, can they? So the fundamental issue remains.

B1/B2 US tourist visa refusal,"A friend with whom I was planning to travel to the United States was rejected under Section 214(b), failure to show strong home ties. In my opinion, her visa interview was handled unprofessionally and unfairly. How often does this happen and can anything be done?
She is Romanian and is about to graduate with an information engineering (Machine Learning) Master's degree from one of the top colleges in the UK. Her family is financially well off, and fully supports her. She does not yet have a job lined up, but she is in a position to start a prestigious career either in the UK or in Romania. 
We had booked a full itinerary. We have both traveled all over Europe, and been to the US before. She had all the relevant documents to prove these things.
Her interview proceeded as follows (slightly simplified):
Q: What do you study? A: Information Engineering. 
Q: What is information engineering? A: bla bla bla
Q: When do you graduate? A: -In a week
Q: Who are you travelling with? A: My boyfriend
Q: What does he study? A: Maths
Q: When does he graduate? A: Same time

Unfortunately, I have to reject you because you are at a particularly flexible stage in your life.

At this point, the interviewer refused to allow her to show any documents including her bank statemeet or travel itinerary, stating that she had already been rejected. I'd also like to add that I am from the UK so do not require a visa.
I understand the logic behind the ""flexible stage"" jsutification; however, it does not make sense for my friend to violate her visa status by working or overstaying because:
1) She does not need the money in the short term (as her bank statement shows).
2) She could get a much better and higher paying job by working legally at home with her qualifications. 
3) Given an appropriate interview, she should have been able to demonstrate as well as anyone that she fully intends to return home.
Is this kind of treatment typical? Is there anything that can be done? Is it worth trying to apply again?

UK visa refusal due to misinterpretation,"I had two UK standard visit visa refusals in this month of June (I am a researcher with one year renewable contract visiting a university in London as part of an assignment from my university). The first refusal was due to some miss interpretations of the invitation letter by the Entry clearance officer (the letter was generic and issued to all the visiting researchers of that university). The second refusal was due to a big misinterpretation of my banking statement (I had some reversal entries (refunds on my debit card) and some small cash deposits in the previous 6 months) The officer didn't check the transaction and cash withdrawals prior to these incoming funds in question (the reversal entries and the small cash deposits) and judged that these funds are most-likely not reflecting my financial situation.
The other reason is that I requested a Business visit visa, and I had no business travel history in my passport (fresh passport).
If I can get a Schengen visa, would that help me with my future UK visa applications ?
Another question: In my second UK visa application, the officer sad that I requested 45 days, but I only requested 4 days, Is there any channel or a way to get clarifications ?
How long is the recommended cooling off period in this type of situation. I need to go to the UK in the next year for two weeks to take part of a scientific training in this university ?.

"Overstayed Schengen Visa, how long to wait before entering again?","I have overstayed a Schengen tourist visa in Hungary by about 2 months, due to just incredible foolishness and not checking visa rules thoroughly. I was denied entry back in, not fined or banned, but my passport was marked. I'm lucky, I know, and Ill never make that mistake again. 
My question is, how long do I have to wait before I can enter the area again? I am a bit confused, as some information I found said 90 days should be fine, but another told me I have to wait for the entire length that I was in Schengen area (so in this case, about 150 days). 
I was going to apply for a work permit before discovering the overstay, which is why I want to return to Hungary as soon as I can.

"Is one entry visa enough for Thailand, first flight-cross over then staying afterwards?","My Girlfriend (Bulgarian) is going on a work vacation trip to India, Vietnam and Thailand.

The ones below are just examples. The one I am thinking about weighs 12.5 kilo.
The question is if flights in general will accept to carry one of these electric scooters as checked-in baggage or if they will refuse?

Can I get my tourist visa on arrival at Indonesia and then extend it?,"I am a UK national and I am travelling to Indonesia for 35 days. Can I get a visa on arrival and then extend it for the required days?

I don't have lots of time before I leave (13th of May) so will I have time to apply for one online?
UPDATE AFTER MY TRIP: 
Here is the process that we went through whilst in Bali.

When you land, before you get your luggage you will have to pass through Immigration. There will most likely be a massive queue for the FREE 30 Day Visa - you don't want this one - you want to pay for a 30 day visa so that you can extend it later. There will be little desks at which you can pay for it. The price is about $35. They give you a little piece of paper that says Visa on it and they point you to the immigration desk. A member of staff there will question your stay (standard procedure: where yourt hotel is, what you are doing here etc...). They will stamp your passport and let you though. 
Two weeks into our stay we went to the Immigration Office located in Jimbaran. On your first day there you will need to bring with you the following:

2 copies of the ID page in your passport
2 copies of the visa page in your passport
Your passport
Confirmations of hotels/flights (not 100% neccessary but good to have)

At the desk you first see, ask for a Visa Extension form. Fill it out.
There is a machine which hands out tickets. Ask a member of staff which button to press as the tickets vary depending on what you're there for and most of the options are coded with abbreviations that no-one understands.
You get your ticket and wait to be called up. They will take your documents and passport. They will then give you a day about A WEEK LATER to come back. KEEP THE DOCUMENTS GIVEN TO YOU SAFE! YOU ARE NOW PASSPORTLESS AND THIS PIECE OF PAPER IS ALL YOU GOT. 
You come back on the given date. On this day they will ask for payment (355,000 IDR) and they will take your photo and fingerprints. You once again need a ticket and so on... You will be given some documents which get passed around the different officials you will encounter and they get stamped a couple of times. You will once again be given a return date about a week later.
Final day. You come to collect your passport. You go to a little side window (ask a member of staff: just say you are here to collect your passport and they will point you in the right direction). You give the forms you have. They just tell you to sit down. At this point you just need to wait and carefully listen out for your name; they are prone to mispronunciations! They will give you your passport and in the visa page you will see a new stamp that says your stay is valid until a much later date. Done!

Ski rental for Mount Gassan,"I'm visiting Japan in late May, early June, and I hope to go skiing. Mount Gassan (月山, literally ""moon mountain"") in Yamagata prefecture seems to be my best bet - it has a ski season of April to July, with the season opening determined not by when they first get snow, but when they can get rid of enough of it to open up the roads!
I asked the tourism information office of Mount Gassan, and they said that ski rental isn't available in Gassan itself. Are there other locations at which ski rental is available?
I anticipate going by shinkansen to Yamagata city, and hiring a car from there, so something in Yamagata city, or between Yamagata city and Gassan would be ideal.
As a fallback, I guess I could try hiring at Zao Onsen, but that's in the opposite direction from Yamagata city as Gassan is!

Ticket Refund Rights with British Airways After Terror Alert Raised at Destination,"I am aware that flight cancellation and refund issues are generally covered by the specific conditions of carriage associated with the ticket. My question  has to do with British Airways in particular however if there is reference for where it is extended for airlines traveling to the UK and USA it would be helpful.
I have a funeral to attend in London on the 22nd and 24th of this month. As most are aware, UK has been hit four times by violent terrorists within the past three months including thrice in the last two weeks alone leading to the threat level in London being raised. It was raised after the first attack to the highest level, and then lowered after which the second attack happened just yesterday. The USA has also issued travel warnings for UK.

The US has issued warnings to its citizens about travelling to the UK
  and continental Europe this summer. An update from the State
  Department, issued on Monday evening, warned that Isis and al-Qaeda
  ‘have the ability to plan and execute terrorist attacks in Europe’

Is one allowed to cancel flights to the destination without penalty in events like this? Is there some general legal precedent establishing this, i.e. a terror attack as a material event? I am asking more for precedent than opinion.
UPDATE: June 4th
Malaysia Airlines has told customers they can get a full refund for any flights booked to London over the coming days in the wake of Saturday’s terror attacks

London terror attacks: Airline offers full refund on flights to London

Is it becoming illegal for a Canadian citizen to enter Canada presenting a foreign passport?,"Some countries (e.g., U.S., Israel) require their citizens to present themselves as such when entering the country - that is, they cannot enter using another country's passport.  In Canada there is no such requirement:  Currently, a Canadian citizen may use another country's passport to enter Canada, if they have one.
Starting March 15, 2016, visa-exempt foreign nationals who fly to Canada will need an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), except for U.S. citizens.
On the eTA application site, it says:

Reminder
You cannot apply for an eTA if you are:

a Canadian citizen or a dual Canadian citizen, ....


Does this mean that when the eTA requirement takes effect, it will become illegal for Canadians to enter Canada by air using a passport from any visa-exempt country other than Canada or the U.S.?  If a Canadian citizen obtains an eTA using their foreign passport and enters Canada with it, what law or regulation will they be violating?

How can a foreign tourist get auto insurance in California USA?,"An adult family member is visiting California, USA from India, for about 3 months. He wants to drive my CA registered car in CA. I already have auto insurance for myself and this car. How can I get auto insurance for him ? I know that a foreign driver can get auto insurance by renting a car. But, I don't want to do that.
What I learned so far ?
1 - The sunrise group offers such insurance. But, my relative believes that their forms are asking for ""too much information"" (foreign address) & is not comfortable with providing it at the quote stage.
2 - Independent agents can help. But, I can't find any agents online who explicitly mention that they can help here. Has anyone tried this option ?
3 - The DMV CA website is not very helpful. The best I could get about international drivers in their website is this and its not at all useful:

International Driving Permits
The State of California does not recognize an International Driving
  Permit (IDP) as a valid driver license. California does recognize a
  valid driver license that is issued by a foreign jurisdiction
  (country, state, territory) of which the license holder is a resident.
The IDP is only a translation of information contained on a person's
  foreign driver license and is not required to operate a motor vehicle
  in California. Citations issued to a person in California who has an
  IDP, but does not have a California driver license will be placed on
  the Department of Motor Vehicle database.
The IDP is also called an International Driver License, International
  License, etc.
For more information about travel and driver licensing requirements
  outside of the US, visit Driving Abroad.

UK Visitor visa refused due to unexplained bank deposits (V4.2 (a-c)). What are my options?,"I applied for a Standard Visitor visa to UK on 23/01/2017. I was notified of refusal on 25/01/2017. The Entry Clearance Officer stated on my refusal notice:



You have applied to visit your uncle in the UK for 18 days, whilst you have provided some documentation relating to your sponsor in UK, I must take into account your personal and economic circumstances in India when coming to my decision.
The starting point for the assessment of any visa application is the information contained in the visa application form and supporting documents.you state that you are a self employed freelance software engineer and earn approximately INR 282,000/year. While you have produced a number of invoices which correspond with deposits to your bank account I note that these funds have all been generated on or after 2 September 2016. There is no indication that you have been generating an income prior to this, despite one of the latter from a client stating that you had been hired by them on a two-year contract from 1 March 2016. I am not satisfied, therefore, that your employment is as stated.

While I had submitted payslips for six month from July, contract agreement letter on company letter head and NOC from the same. I also submitted some invoices from other company, shops and persons for whom I worked between September 2016 to January 2017. I also have another two running contracts to make software for them and for these I also submitted agreements.
Second point of the refusal notice is:

You have stated that further large deposits to your bank account were made following the Indian Government's currency reform, announced on 8 November 2016. Deposits totaling INR 296,824 were credited to your account between 13 November 2016 and 12 January 2017. As you have given an itemized breakdown of the income generated through your stated employment, the provenance of these funds is unclear. These further causes me to doubt that your circumstances are as claimed and I cannot rule out the possibility that these funds were deposited in order to enhance your visa application.

I deposited INR 233,500 which I had cash on hand as per my balance sheet for income tax return of 2015/2016, I clearly  mentioned this in covering latter. After all I withdrew all this money before I made January 2017.
Third and last point officer stated that:

given this and lack of documentation submitted regarding your personal circumstances, I consider that you have fail to show sufficiently strong family, Social or economic ties to India, and assess that there is little to encourage you to leave UK completion of a visit. I may not satisfied that you have presented an accurate picture of your economic circumstances in India or your intentions in the UK.

Can I reapply right now?

UK visit visa refusal," 
My girlfriend recently applied for a visit visa as shown; it was refused. I submitted that I will pay for all her trip and I have a good job and good pay.

It's asks for finance in her country but I'm unsure as to what they require. She lives at home with her parents and a big family. So because she lives at home she gets taken care of by her parents. She was employed but ended the employment as I went to visit her and they wouldn't give her the time off in holidays. And straight after we applied for the visa for her to visit me. I stated I will take Care of everything including travel accommodation and I will travel to her country bring her to uk and take her back again. I'm a little confused on what we can do to make a better application. Thanks all Andy

UK visa refused because I failed to provide satisfactory evidence of being a student. What are my options?,"I had applied for UK visa recently and it got refused.
My trip was funded by my brother in law and my dad so,

The reason for refusal were as follows.

I have refused your application for a visit visa because I am not satisfied that you meet the requirements of paragraph(s) V 4.2 of Appendix V: Immigration Rules for Visitors because:
You have sought entry as a visitor for thirty days and have described yourself as a student at Mithibai College, you have stated that you are currently studying Bachelor of Commerce and Chartered accountancy, however you have failed to submit any evidence confirming this. You have failed to submit any evidence of your studies and confirmation of when you will complete this course.

The IATA states:


alcoholic beverages, for passengers aged 17 and older:
  
  
1 liter of spirits over 22% volume, or non-denatured ethyl alcohol with more than 80% volume; or
2 liters of spirits or aperitifs made of wine or similar beverages less than 22% volume, or sparkling wines or liquor wines; or
a proportional mix of these products; and in addition
4 liters still wine; and

The taxation and custom union websites from the EU states:

Alcoholic beverages (a)
          a total of 1 litre of alcohol and alcoholic beverages of an alcoholic strength exceeding 22% vol, or undenatured ethyl alcohol of 80% vol and over (b); or
      a total of 2 litres of alcoholic beverages of an alcoholic strength not exceeding 22% vol.(b)
      a total of 4 litres of still wine, and
      16 litres of beer (only for VAT and excise duty)

The tax and custom administration website of the Netherlands in the abbreviated version states:

1 litre of spirits, whisky for example, or 2 litres of wine or 16 litres of beer

Which clearly contradicts their information in a more detailed list:

Alcoholic products
  You are not liable for tax for the import of:
  1 litre of spirits or
  2 litres of sparkling wine or
  2 litres of fortified wine, such as sherry or port and
  4 litres of non-sparkling wine and

Now, I plan to travel to Italy on business from July 8th to 16th.  
Can travel with the same visa in old passport, or should I cancel the existing visa and apply for a new one?
I contacted the Netherlands Embassy call center (not VFS Netherlands) which responded that I can use it without any issues. However, they have not confirmed it by email. 
I asked about any immigration issues in Italy and was told me that, if I have a valid itinerary and invitation letter from the office, there should be no problem. I was also told that Italian immigration authorities are able to contact the Dutch, if necessary. 
I emailed the Italian Embassy in Mumbai (visa.mumbai@esteri.it) and await its response.

To visit Paris on return from NL,"Will visit Amsterdam for 45 days from July first week to mid August. This is an official visit, company sponsored. I've already been to Italy a few times and Amsterdam once before. My plan is to visit Paris on one of the weekends. Seems I can do so with the NL Schengen visa I've got. But my question is.....
Usually my tickets are booked on Lufthansa - India to Frankfurt to Ams and same way back.
If I can persuade the travel manager to book the return through Paris instead of Germany with a transit gap of 10 hours or more , then can I utilize this time to visit Paris (just Eiffel tower trip and Louvre museum) ?

Where is Forrest Fenn's treasure located?,"

As I have gone alone in there
And with my treasures bold,
I can keep my secret where,
And hint of riches new and old.
Begin it where warm waters halt
And take it in the canyon down,
Not far, but too far to walk.
Put in below the home of Brown.
From there it's no place for the meek,
The end is ever drawing nigh;
There'll be no paddle up your creek,
Just heavy loads and water high.
If you've been wise and found the blaze,
Look quickly down, your quest to cease,
But tarry scant with marvel gaze,
Just take the chest and go in peace.
So why is it that I must go
And leave my trove for all to seek?
The answers I already know,
I've done it tired, and now I'm weak.
So hear me all and listen good,
Your effort will be worth the cold.
If you are brave and in the wood
I give you title to the gold.

Is an Australian required to fly in and out of Brazil to activate a tourist visa?,"My wife is Australian and we recently started a trip to South America without realising she would need a visa to enter Brazil. The process is more complicated than for Europeans so we decided to sort the visa out in La Paz (Bolivia) as it takes only 2 working days (10 is normal in Australia). 
When we went to the consulate they said that we needed entry and exit flights to Brazil for the visa to be granted. Currently we have exit flights but we're planning to enter Brazil by land near Puerto Suarez (Bolivia) and Corumba (Brazil). This has obviously greatly affected our plans due to increased costs, flight destinations and activities we can complete.
My question:
Do Australians have to have entry and exit flights for a tourist visa (we will be in Brazil for maximum two weeks)?
We have looked into other entry points (Iguazu falls Argentina) which visas can be granted in a matter of hours at an overland border and are confused as to why the visa requirements are different (I presume we wouldn't have to enter Brazil immediately if we got this). This isn't a viable alternative for us. The same applies to getting the visa in Buenos Aires (I don't know if the requirements would be the same as in La Paz).
It is difficult to know if the grumpy visa attendant we got was telling us all the options or whether we should investigate further at the Australian Embassy to enable us to travel our desired route.
We have done significant research on This subject but none of the blog posts mentioning getting Australian visas in South America deal with our particular dilemma so any advice would be appreciated.

Second UK visa refusal under V4.2(a) and (b); what can I change?,"My visa application to visit for training and taking exams has been refused twice, on grounds that the cost of my trip represents three times more my stated disposable income.

Disposable income: £428 as per the ECO calculation after deducting my expenses from my income
Stated trip cost: £1500
However, I wrote £535 as a rough estimate. I send money home to my family sometimes, and I normally save all my salary. I earn extra income from tips and allowances, and receive a food allowance, too, which I did mention. I don't think that this was considered, although it's evident on my pay slips which show £200 food allowance and service charge, and £220 per week in tips. 
I want to visit for 4 days in July to attend a training, and 2 days in Septmeber to sit an exam. The cost of the trip came to be £1500 and includes flights, hotel, and food. I have already paid in advance for flights, accommodation, and training fees, and I attached the receipts.

In my next application, should I reduce my monthly expenditures?
Should I reduce the cost of the trip to only food and ground transportation, and state that the flights and hotel are paid for, attaching receipts as evidence?

Getting from Buenos Aires to Bogota,"My partner and I have purchased cheap return tickets flying in and out of Buenos Aires, Argentina 6 months apart.
We are planning on travelling south from Colombia to Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and then fly out from BA.
What is the ""best"" way to get from Buenos Aires to Bogota to start our trip southwards? Flights are currently $850 AUD (about $700 USD) each direct, which is very expensive. Cost is not the only consideration, as long as we can gather some great experiences on the way - but we are travelling for 12 months in total, so the flights are a huge hit on the budget.
We are considering that we can fly from Rio (Brazil) to Manaus for $140 AUD (about $100 USD) each, so it may be worth going via Iguazu Falls and Brazil, then going overland to Bogota. The problem is that I'm Australian, so the Brazilian visa fee is about $200 AUD (my partner is Kiwi, so doesn't need a visa).
We are in no great hurry, we can take about 2 weeks.
The one other option we are considering is buying a car and driving it. I believe it's impossible to buy a car in Argentina and travel across borders, but it may be possible to purchase in Paraguay and travel up that way to Colombia.
Would love to hear some suggestions, especially from people who have travelled from BA to Bogota. I know there's no perfect answer, but we are just trying to weigh up the best option for us.

Is it safe for people of Indian descent to visit Russia?,"I am an individual of Indian (person from India) descent. I have been asked by my company to travel to Russia later this year to carry out a market survey related to consumer durables. I will have to spend around 3 months in Russia, especially in Moscow, Volgograd,Vladivostok & Saint Petersburg. 
However, based on information provided by various Western media groups related to safety in Russia, it seems any individual who is not White can be targeted in Russia by Neo-Nazis, Neo-Fascist and skinhead groups. Moreover it seems law enforcing authorities in Russia also harass dark skinned people.

The US state department in its travel advisory pertaining to Russia states:

Incidents of unprovoked, violent harassment against racial and ethnic
  minorities regularly occur throughout the Russian Federation.
  Travelers should exercise caution wherever large crowds have gathered.
  U.S. citizens most at risk are those of African, South Asian, or East Asian descent, or those who, because of their complexion, are
  perceived to be from the Caucasus region or the Middle East. These
  U.S. citizens are also at risk for harassment by police authorities.

Similarly the Canadian Government in its travel advisory regarding Russia states:

Crime against foreigners is a serious problem. Harassment and
  attacks are prevalent, especially for foreigners of Asian and African
  descent. Some victims have died.

I also came across a RT video that spoke about how an Indian student was stabbed to death in Moscow by skinheads.
So, I have two questions in this regard:
(1) What are the chances of physical violence against people, who are not of European descent?
(2) Is it difficult to find accommodation in cities like Moscow if you are not European?

Is it good courtesy to leave the bed made when checking out of accomodation?,"I was always taught to leave the room in a clean condition when checking out of an accomodation. When staying somewhere with my parents, we gave the room a look-over and tidy it up into the condition we found it before we left for the last time.

While I understand the reasoning behind this - It's considerate towards the people who have to clean the room to make their lives easier - I have also had discussions with other people where making the bed in particular is a point of disagreement. Since the bed is going to be stripped down in any case, it is useless to make it since it's going to be un-made almost as soon as you leave.
I understand this is probably a minor point, but I would like to be courteous and also efficient. I don't want to spend my time cleaning the room so thoroughly for no reason. If I leave my bed un-made, is that rude?

Worst case scenario is I get deported or have to pay a fine when I leave or return. If I was asked to leave the country, I'm fairly certain there would be a legal way around it since I'm married to a Brazilian national. Perhaps applying for the permanent visa. So it's cause for some anxiety, but I'm not particularly worried about it.
My problem is this. I just realized my United States passport expires in mid-March. I'm supposed to renew it at a local embassy or consulate. Due to my illegal status, I obviously don't want to do that.
So, I'm wondering. Is there anything to stop me from mailing my current passport to the United States and having a family member have it renewed by mail for me and then send it back to Brazil? Are there any considerations to be taken in doing this? What are the risks?

"OK, we are all adults here, so what is a bidet for and how do I use it?","Confession time: I am from one of these barbaric countries where the use of the bidet is not widespread. So I have no idea...
Question 1: What is the bidet good for? 
Question 2: How do I use it?

Image Source: wikipedia
Apparently the bidet is a necessity of daily life in some countries and we have already had questions such as
OK we are all adults here, so really, how on earth should I live without bidet?
but to my surprise nobody has ever questioned as to how to use them. 
Assuming I'd be travelling to e.g. Italy and encounter such a bidet in my hotel bathroom, 

What should I use it for?
What should I not use it for?
How should I use it?
How should I not use it?
Bonus question: What is the social aspect of bidet usage in countries where they are widespread? Is it implicitly assumed everybody uses this device on a weekly/daily/hourly basis? Should I dare not talk about it or is there no taboo around it? E.g. when I say ""I just used the bidet."" does that sound like ""I just washed my hands"" or is that akin to ""I just took a dump"", i.e. a rather awkward thing to mention as small talk?

This is perfectly on-topic here on Travel SE as part of the bathroom usage 101 series (not in chronological order, omissions possible):

OK we are all adults here, so really, how on earth should I live without bidet? 
OK we're all adults here, so really, how on earth should I use a squat toilet?
OK we're all nerds here, so really, how on earth should I use a Japanese toilet?
We're all adults here - how to use a squat toilet if you have trouble squatting?
Are the hoses in toilets in Asia something I should know about?
How to use toilet paper
How do you use a traditional hot-air hand dryer so your hands are actually dry afterwards?

You could assume for this question I have no physical disabilities that would e.g. cause me trouble squatting.

Why didn't the UK visa officer ask for financial documents?,"Recently, my parents had an interview in Pune for a UK tourist visa. They had originals of all of their bank statements and their passport with them, but the official did not ask them to submit them. Even though they asked, the officer said they were not needed.

What is an acceptable time to wait for other passengers in a songthaew in Thailand?,"Today I was taking a Songthaew (shared taxi) in Krabi Town and there were only three passengers, me and two friends, present. The normal fare after 6pm is 60 baht.
We were offered to start the ride immediately if we paid 40 additional baht per person (100 instead of 60) or to wait until three more passengers would arrive. We declined the offer assuming that we would not have to wait long.
Nobody arrived for ~20 min and I asked how long we would wait for more passengers. I was told that the shift ends in 1.5 h and that is how long he would wait. After additional ~15 min I agreed to pay the extra and we drove off. We were asked to pay the money in advance, usually passengers pay at the destination.

Hypothetical roaming scenarios,"As I understand it, roaming is the part of a phone connection which uses the infrastructure of a non-domestic network (is that correct?).
Lets say my mobile carrier is German, and I have a tariff with unlimited domestic calls. We also assume the newly abolished roaming charges. Are my interpretations in the following scenarios correct?

I call a French number located outside of Germany from Germany. In this case I pay whatever the price my operator puts on international calls to France, as long as it's located within the EU(or do I pay different charges depending on his location?). If he were lets say in India, I'd pay for a call to India (or would I pay for a call to France and he would pay the rest? I'm not sure.).
I call a French number located within Germany from Germany. I still pay for a call to France since the connection first goes to his operator in France, who then serves him with my call.
I call the same French number located anywhere within the EU, from within the EU but outside of Germany. Now I don't pay anything since all calls from outside your EU home-country to another EU country are considered roaming (which paradoxically makes my telephony cheaper outside then within Germany. What is the logic behind this?).
I call a German number located outside of Germany, but within the EU, from Germany. I don't pay anything since my operator is serving me all the way, in contrast to 1. (Before the new regulation I would pay for using non-domestic infrastructure).

renting/letting/hire/location a scooter in Paris France (from US),"Backstory: My wife and I are in Paris for a week (this week) and looking to travel around and see the sites, are we in district 14 and looking at some of the site's we want to see are all best traveled (seemingly) by car/moto.  I have had my Motorcycle license in the states for 8 Years.
Question: What is required to rent a scooter/motorcycle in France (Paris) and what are the dangers?  I've seen a lot of information online stating number of scooters stolen (1 Every 5 Minutes).  Should I taxi instead or use the train? It seems scooters are cheaper if we can both ride one together.  What is required to ride with a passenger?

Finding public shower in Europe,"While there are plenty of questions on SE Travel like Where to shower in X or Y I wasn't able to find a common approach to finding cheap or free public showers. For example, how do long-haul truckers usually make shower in Europe?
I do know about WarmShowers community, but it seems that they accept only cyclists which is not the case for me. Let's take the common case any traveler faced in his life:

You are a single traveler
You are making a layover or short stop in some city, airport or bus station
You have a fair amount of time (3-4 hours)
You do not intend to book any hotel in that city.
You are just looking for a shower.

Is there any decent strategy I can use in any European country to find a public shower? If someone can share some strategy concerning worldwide, you are welcome, while I doubt there will be any common features in such diverse communities like Czech and Japan, for example. 
P.S. By word cheap I mean €5-10 max.

My signature in my passport looks different than it actually is - consequences?,"I have a German passport, an ID card and a driver's licence. The signature in the latter is seven years old and looks completely different from the current signature - which so far was fine since where I live it isn't used for identification. 
What concerns me way more is the fact that I am going to travel from Europe to South East Asia. The electronic device that was used to capture my signature on had an abysmal sampling rate. The resulting signature in my passport looks vaguely similar to my actual signature. It looks like a child tried to forge my signature. Same issue with my ID. The signature on the passport and on the ID don't look the same.
Are there going to be issues at the airport or somewhere else when officers try to identify me even though the image in the passport strongly resembles me?
(Bonus question: Is the speed with which I wrote the strokes recorded and used for identification? I adapted my writing speed to the tablet's sampling rate which probably does not correlate in any way with the real speed.)
If it matters: In my country, passports of citizens younger than 24 years are only valid for 6 years, otherwise 10 years. One could argue at the airport that I'm still young and my signature underlies changing. I'm not really comfortable with arguing with airport officers.

"Delhi, Beijing or Japan for sightseeing in May with a teenage daughter?","I will have about 15-20 days in May to travel with my daughter (who will be 14). We are from Brazil and she has never been abroad, so I thought I would like to bring her to some place with unique sights.
I would like that this trip have a semi-backpacking feel (but avoiding cheap shared hostels). However I would like to keep day travelling to a minimum (train sleepers are fine though). Low budget cities are a big plus. Good sights around a major city, attractive to teens (short attention span, likes different stuff, places and museums, but easily bored).  
Delhi seems to have some pretty nice culture and sights without much travel around. The route Beijing -> Xian (with some other destination) seems nice, but I'm not sure how travel friendly it is, maybe just staying in Beijing would be enough for two weeks.  
I'm torn between Delhi and Beijing. Japan in my daughter's choice, but I think it might be too expensive and everything seems far away. I think the language barrier will be a plus. She will see the need for a second language (and maybe a third) and train a bit of her school English. I think she wants Japan mostly because she is into anime now, apart from that I don't really see her looking into Japanese culture.

How can I find a hotel that can fill out a registration form for temporary visitors in China?,"How can I find a hotel that can fill out a registration form for temporary visitors in China?
I am in a small town not so far from Nanning at the moment. I have a double entry tourist visa with about ten days left. I am considering going to the PSB to extend the visa. I guess they will not extend anything without a ""Registration form of temporary residence for visitors"". I went around in the smaller hotels and asked if they could fill out a form. It seems like many small hotels won't do it. I found a business hotel that said they could do it, if I brought the form for them. So the question really is, can I use a black and white photocopied copy of the form printed from the Internet or do I need to find a hotel that has its own supply of this form that they can fill out? And is it enough if the hotel just fills it out so I can bring it to the PSB or do they have to do some registration work on a computer as well? I think the original copies are pink in color, my photocopy is black and white.

Adapter voltage different to both mains power and appliance expectations,"Sorry if this is a question better suited to Electronics.SE.
I'll be travelling from my home country of Australia to the Philippines tomorrow, and been looking for a suitable travel adapter. Unfortunately given the time constraint the only I've been able to find for type A/B sockets is a US adapter. This would be fine, except the adapter is explicitly labelled as being for 110-125V. Australia uses 240V, while the Philippines is on 220V as best I can tell - a small enough difference that it shouldn't be an issue for charging small devices like phones. My question is, is using a 110V adapter likely to cause any problems when the source and destination voltages are the same, but different (higher) than the adapter's rating?

Update
For those curious, I did use one of those adapters and it all worked fine in the end - didn't blow up any devices (or itself), and didn't get too hot while plugged in. I do recommend caution all the same when dealing with adapters of unknown quality - but it looks like as long as the adapter isn't one with a voltage transformer and the source/destination voltages are roughly the same, the situation described in this question should be OK.

Charged for fuel surcharge after re-booking a flight. Fair?,"I booked a flight from Seattle to Paris for June 10th with Air France, but realized I could not make the flight. I called the customer service of the airline because I wanted to re-book my flight, which I successfully did! 
The customer service representative informed me that the total fee for re-booking (150 euros or ~168$) + the difference in price of the two different flights (the new one on August 20th - my original one on June 10th of 106 $) would be charged to my account.
Surprisingly, I found that I was charged 274$ on the date I called customer service and an additional 320$ two days after the flight. When I called customer service I found out (after more than half an hour of waiting on the line) that the 320$ was for fuel surcharge. 
First, I wasn't informed initially about this additional cost that was charged on my credit card. Second, I just read that this fuel surcharge is a bit of a lame excuse from the airline companies to charge you more for the fare (a fact which is not bothersome by itself, but why wouldn't this fee be covered by the cancellation fee?).
The main question would be if I can do anything to get my money back.

Which trains in France are included in an InterRail card?,"I have two questions related to an InterRail in France I'm planning to have in August.

How to cope with too slow Wi-Fi at hotel?,"So many hotels I stayed at (3~4 stars ratings) provided too slow Wi-Fi. The speed is somewhere around 2~3Mbps, and it frequently falls down to <200Kbps.
However, once you find that your hotel provides such a terrible Wi-Fi environment, is there anything still that you can take an action there? In hotel search websites, many hotels are tagged with Free Wi-Fi or even Hi-Speed Wi-Fi but it is not reliable in my experience. 
Note that I'm not asking for whether it is possible to know the quality of Wi-Fi at hotel in advance, which has been posted in this question. What I ask here is how you can deal with it when you find your hotel provides a terrible Wi-Fi.
Usually, I get through it by going into cafe with 
Wi-Fi. But still, the cafe might not provide you with a good connection. Also I want to use my Mac in midnight, when most cafes are not open in general.
I also make sure to contract a local SIM with 4G/LTE and tethering capability, but still, the tethering fails to connect too frequently in many cases.
This is what is happening on me right now in Shanghai, that the hotel's is terrible, all cafes I tried (including Starbucks) suck, and China Unicom 4G/LTE is too slow even without VPN. It's really stressful...
So is there still anything I can do to assure the good network environment? (except changing the hotel which I do once the current booking ends)
My point is that I want to use my Mac whenever I want (including midnight), since it is a part of my job (working while traveling). The minimum requirement is a stable access to GitHub and Stack Overflow and fast google search responses. I don't need much speed (around 7 ~ 10Mbps is sufficient) but cannot tolerate <2Mbps, since it takes me to wait for so long. For me, the stable, undisconnected network is far more important than the speed and latency, once it is above 3Mbps. I don't download/upload large files at once (e.g. videos or hi-res pictures or big softwares, those with >500MB).

If a list of countries is required, I ask for Hong Kong and China (Shanghai/Beijing). But this occurred in Singapore and Japan as well. South Korea never bothered me in this regard, though, as the major cities are full of terrific Wi-Fi cafes.

Do I break the law as a foreigner in Germany if an embassy keeps my passport to stick a visa in?,"An Armenian national lives in Germany and holds a permanent residence (Niederlassungserlaubnis). This is a sticker in their Armenian passport. They have applied at the UK embassy in Berlin to get a standard visitor visa, which will likely be granted. The UK embassy kept their passport and said issuing and sticking the visa into the passport will take five days. After those five days, they will be able to reclaim their passport.
However, German residence act (Aufenthaltsgesetz) § 3 says that as a foreigner you have to have a passport with you (English source, German source).

(1) Foreigners may only enter or stay in the federal territory if they are in possession of a recognised and valid passport or passport substitute, unless they are exempt from the passport obligation by virtue of a statutory instrument. For the purpose of residence in the federal territory, possession of a substitute identity document shall also suffice in order to meet the passport obligation (Section 48 (2)).

Section 48 says they have to give that document to the German authorities if they need it, i.e. for a control.
Also when asked, the Berlin foreigners office (Auslaenderbehoerde) says as the holder of a residence permit you should carry your passport around at all times.
So within those five days, they have a passport and a valid visa for Germany, but they cannot carry it around with them as it's with the UK embassy. 
How do they fulfill the obligation to have their passport with them all the time? Are they breaking the law?

Why were water bottles confiscated in a boarding gate jetway in Hong Kong?,"Seeing another question about taking water bottles onto planes reminded me of an interesting incident I ran into once. During a layover in Hong Kong in late May of 2013, as we were boarding a flight to Los Angeles, there were security personnel actually in the jetway searching through everyone's carry-on luggage and confiscating water bottles that still had water in them. Since only empty bottles were allowed to get through security or transfer security to even get to the gate, this means that all of the water being confiscated was either purchased or obtained from a water fountain in the airside concourse. As such, I was confused as to why it was being confiscated. Also, this was not done on a different departure I had from Hong Kong only a couple of weeks before that or on any other flight I've ever been on anywhere.
So, my question is, does anyone know why they would confiscate water that was obtained in the secure departures area of the airport in the jetway as passengers were boarding a flight?
The only even remotely reasonable explanation I could think of is that it could have something to do with taking extra precaution to prevent the spread of avian flu, since there was an outbreak in China at the time, though I didn't hear any kind of announcement of this not being allowed until we were already actually in the jetway past the boarding gate.
Less likely, this was during the time that Edward Snowden was in Hong Kong, so perhaps this was a pretense to search luggage of U.S.-bound flights for some reason related to that, but this seems very unlikely, especially since this was between the time he arrived in Hong Kong and when he went public with the information.

TSA Security for oversized items?,"Recently I attempted to check in 50 minutes prior to a US domestic flight.  But I was denied checking my suitcase and was told by the airline employee that I could only check baggage up to 1 hour before a flight1.  I was given the choice of taking my (full sized) suitcase on my original flight as hand luggage or rebooking on another, later flight.  For various reasons I opted for the re-booking (which in hindsight made for a horrendous travel experience due to unrelated issues).
But I am curious to know how the TSA should have handled me attempting to take my suitcase through the TSA checkpoint.  Being a full sized suitcase it would not have fitted through the X-Ray machine, and I am not even sure that they would have even allowed me to proceed through security with it2.  I assume that there are probably hand search policies that they can apply, but this is so far out of my experience that I have no clue.   
Can anyone explain what the TSA should3 have done in the case of me attempting to get a full-sized suitcase through a TSA security checkpoint when said suitcase would not fit through an x-ray machine?
Note that there was also nothing in my suitcase that I could not have taken onto the plane in hand luggage. 

I am also guessing that taking my suitcase through security is actually less secure than checking it.  My belief is that after a bag is checked that there should be some sort of automated scanning applied to it, but at the TSA checkpoint they could not do a similar level of scanning and would have to rely solely on visual inspections.
Can anyone tell me if I am right or wrong in this respect?


1. In subsequent emails with the airlines customer service, it was pointed out that this was a TSA rule and not an airline rule.
2. I have previously seen airlines/security aggressively enforce size and weight restrictions on standard carry on sized luggage before even getting to the TSA checkpoint.  So I can't imagine what they would have thought seeing me dragging my ""hand luggage"" along
3. Note that I say should rather than would because I know how capricious the TSA can be.

"Should I turn down the high beam in ""deer areas""?","In the answers to this question, there is some discussion about use of full beam when driving in deer areas.  Thorsten S. writes:

If you are using high beams, wild animals will stop and stare hypnotically into your light and given the high speeds cause severe accidents. There are always some warnings in German travel radio if deer has been sighted on the autobahn.

I had never heard this before.  Several commenters disagree, as do some internet sources, such as the humane society page on tips to avoid deer collisions notes:

Use your high beams at night to see farther ahead. Slow down and watch for the eye-shine of deer near road edges.

Is there any empirical evidence that shows which one is safer?  Of course, if turning down the high beam forces one to reduce speed to 30 km/h that does reduce the risk of deer collisions, but would increase the risk of being rear-ended unless one is alone on the road.  I'm looking for evidence on whether the high beam actually increases the risk of deer collisions, all other things being equal.

Explain meaning of Mumbai scams,"While reading about Mumbai on wikitravel, before my next business trip, I have found information about two scams, said to be popular in this city (or entire India?), which either lacks details or is completely not understandable by me. I will appreciate any help in explaining them.
First, in ""To and from airport"" section:

There is a well-known scam with the employees here replacing your 500 rupee bill with a 100 rupee bill and giving you change for the latter.

Either I'm dumb, or I don't follow it. If employee is replacing my 500 rupee bill with 100 rupee bill and then he is giving me a change for the rest, then where seems to be the scam here?
Then, in ""Stay safe"" section there's a note:

There is a scam, in which a persons asks you for a change of 1000 INR currency note. Once you give him two 500 INR notes he changes these notes to two 100 INR without you noticing and thus demands 800 INR more from you. Beware when someone asks you change for 1000 INR.

Now, this is something, that I completely don't understand. In details:

when someone asks for a change for 1000 INR bill, then why should I handle him 2500 INR?
even if I give him 2500 INR bill, which he replace with 2100 INR bill (is there such bill anyway), then how can he ask for ""missing"" 800 INR, if 2500-2100 = 400 INR?

What's the use of trains that spend 6+ hours of daytime en route?,"There's such thing as ""a daytime train"" - a train which runs all the route during daytime. Some of them run really long routes - 500-700 kilometers - and a train spends 6-8 hours en route to run such distances.

I cannot see why I would use such a train instead of an overnight train which departs at 22:00 and arrives 06:00-08:00 the next day - sleeping on a train is not the best experience one gets but it's quite possible.

How can a tourist obtain an 'authentic' duelling scar?,"Introduction...

The dueling scar, also called schmiss or renommierschmiss (bragging scar), was considered a mark of honor. Young fraternity men proved their valor in these duels, which were considered an essential rite of passage into high society for government officials, doctors and professors. 

Source: Real Men Have Dueling Scars
I did some post graduate work at Ruprecht-Karls-Universität and am intimately aware that there are societies who arrange both public and  clandestine rendez-vous's near the ruins of the ancient castle which now forms a part of the Heidelberg Municipal Park.

Source: Sebastian Münster Public Domain
Sometimes taking place at these events are sabre duels conducted for sport, pleasure, and bragging rights. And one desired outcome of a sabre duel is rakishly attractive duelling scar. When delivered in the right setting, these scars are 'authentic' because they echo a centuries old tradition in central European folklore.  Also, not just Heidelberg, there are (or were) hundreds these societies throughout central Europe and all of them can stake a claim to 'authenticity'. There's an interesting photo of a  contemporary dueller with a fresh wound here. 
Also this one...
 
I never gave a thought to whether or not these activities were accessible to tourists. And in all cases, if there are any legal boundaries that might intervene one's plans.
Question: how would a tourist go about arranging an authentic duelling scar on relatively short notice?  Say 'short notice' means 3 months or less.  I am aware that I could go to a doctor or even do it myself, but this would not be authentic.
Also, these things hurt and in addition to requiring stitches, you can't shave that side of your face for about 12 days (most often and counter intuitively the left side, but sometimes the right side). Are there other precautions a tourist should take note of (e.g., applying local aesthetic prior to the event or stocking up on pain killers or getting one's clothes cleaned afterwards or what to wear)?
Note that protective clothing is handled as a part of the tradition and provided by the society. But protective gear in modern times is no where near as baroque as  American novelist Mark Twain described it...

The duelers eyes are protected by iron goggles which project an inch or more.  The leather straps of the goggles bind their ears flat against their heads and these straps are wound around and around with thick wrappings which a sword could not cut through.  From chin to ankle they are padded thoroughly against injury; their arms are bandaged and rebandaged, layer upon layer, until they look like solid black logs.  They resembled beings one sees in nightmares. Their arms which projected straight out from their bodies are so heavy that fellow-students walk beside them and help to support them.

Source: Mark Twain and Dueling Scars
Secondarily: is it legal for a tourist to participate in a clandestine sabre duel?  Or even publicly announced sabre duel? I am informed that there are also public events, but do not know if the authorities will allow tourists to participate.

German military laws permitted men to wage duels of honor until World War I, and in 1933 the Nazi government legalized the practice once more.

"In the UK, what is the difference between ""Leave to Enter"" and a visa?","In most countries that I have traveled to, a visa is a document / attestation that allows you to travel to the country's borders in order to request temporary entry, because you are not normally entitled to enter the country.
The visa may state the nature and purpose of your visit (for example, F1 is a student visa in the US) or it may not (for example, my Schengen visa just states ""Schengen Visa"" type ""C"").
Visas usually also have a validity period and sometimes contain other restrictions (for example, my Saudi visit visa only allows one entry, the Schengen visa allows multiple entries).
However, for the UK it seems things are a bit different. According to Wikipedia:

Leave to Enter is the technical term for someone granted entry to the
  United Kingdom by British immigration officers.

Is this a separate document / stamp? How is it related to the visa (if one needs to apply for to begin with).
Also, curiously, why is called ""Leave to Enter"" - ""leave"" where? Presumably you are already ""in"" the UK when you get this permission?

The border control of the country in question won't care about the flight tickets, so as long as you show them your new passport, they'll be fine with it, but I believe the airline might pose more of discomfort. Any ideas or experiences?

Which Finnish operator allows for online top-ups with international cards and has reasonable limit on roaming within the EU?,"Since the EU is about to abolish roaming fees, I am considering buying a foreign SIM card to use at home and abroad for mobile data. My own operator here in Czech Republic is also part of the free roaming scheme, however domestic prices are extremely high (by EU standards), so it would be a lot cheaper to go for a foreign operator.
Looking at the map of mobile data prices in Europe, it seems that going for a Finnish data tariff is a good choice. So the question is — which Finnish operator allows online top-ups with a Visa/Mastercard and has reasonable limits on roaming within the EU?

Why do airlines offer more varieties of special-request meals than they actually provide?,"I am a lacto-ovo vegetarian with an annoying tendency to forget to book vegetarian meals when I go flying. When I forget to book ahead, I always ask if they happen to have an extra veg*n meal, but quite understandably they never do: they have precisely what has been pre-booked and nothing more. Which makes sense.
Whenever I do remember to book a veg meal well ahead of time, I always specify lacto-ovo vegetarian (i.e., with milk, cheese, cream, eggs, etc., just no fish or meat) if I can.
Despite this, I don’t believe I’ve ever actually been served a lacto-ovo vegetarian meal on any flight I’ve been on: the meal served is invariably vegan, despite me booking it well ahead of time as a lacto-ovo vegetarian one. Personally, I find this a bit annoying, because it means pretty much everything gets switched out for beans, rice, raw fruit, and crackers. Everyone else gets yoghurts and cakes—I get carrots and apple sauce. Boo.
I realise that the airlines don’t make the food themselves and have little control over what the dish of the day will be on any particular flight on any given day, but the fact that they do generally explicitly offer the choice between different kinds of veg*n meals would, I assume, imply that Gourmet Gate and similar flight meal companies do make these different variations of meals. If the companies that make the meals only made regular and vegan, there’d be no reason at all for the airlines to ask for any more details.
One also presumes that it would be very easy for these companies to make gradations. A lacto-ovo meal, for instance, would generally just have to switch one component (the meat in the main dish) for a veggie option, which my limited understanding of how meal factories work leads me to believe would be simpler and cheaper than a vegan meal where more or less everything is substituted. True, it would require some additional start-up cost to set up an extra packaging combination, but given the quantities of food these companies make, this extra cost doesn't seem like it ought to be prohibitive.
The way I see it, there are two basic tenets here that work against each other for the airlines:

Offering a broad variety of dietary options is good PR and customer service
Having to pay for a broad variety of dietary options is bad for business

Obviously a compromise between these two must be found. That is a given.
I have, on occasion, come across airlines who sacrificed customer service for business in this context and basically only offered a regular meal and a vegan meal. No other options. That's understandable and consistent, if not particularly satisfying for the customer.
The vast majority of airlines, however, seem to basically try to avoid the compromise altogether: they offer a full deck of dietary combinations, but once you get on the plane, they only actually provide regular or vegan.
To me, this seems to be a very strange decision. As a customer, I may be a bit disappointed to be told that I can only choose between regular and fully vegan, but at least my expectations are met. I am definitely going to be a lot more annoyed to be told that I've successfully booked a lacto-ovo meal, only to be given something different when I'm on the flight.
I have limited experience with halal, kosher, etc., but the few times I have travelled with people who booked meals like that, they have gotten special meals—not vegan ones. Conversely, as Itai mentions in the comments, lactose-intolerant people generally get served the vegan meal as well, and I've seen gluten-free bookings go the same way.
So why do airlines nearly always offer a broad variety of dietary options, including lacto-ovo vegetarian and lactose- and gluten-free, when you book and order your meal; but conflate most non-regular options and only provide a vegan option on the actual flight?

Umweltzone sticker for a car that matches restrictions but not age limit,"I want to drive my car to the city of Stuttgart. I understand I need an umweltzone sticker for this. 
According to ANWB (The place that distributes these stickers in the Netherlands) these are the possible requirements for the green stickers:

Vehicle needs to be built after 31 december 1992
Vehicle has emission norm Euro-1, Euro-2, Euro-3 or Euro-4.
Vehicles with hybrid motors also get green stickers

'No sticker will be provided to cars built before 31 december 1992. If the car is built before this date and does have a motor with emission class Euro-2, you get a red sticker.'
Now, my car, a Porsche 911 964 built in 15 october 1992, goes by Euro norm 2. This model was built until late '93, and if it rolled out of the factory a few months later, it would have gotten a green sticker without any issues.

France Business Visa For Attending OpenSource Conference,"I have been invited to speak at EuroBSDCon 2017 in Paris this year. First of all, a bit about me and the conference.
I'm a software engineer based in Hyderabad, India. I am also a contributor to the NetBSD project, which is a volunteer driven open source project. There are thousands of developers all around the globe which contribute to NetBSD and other similar open source projects (such as FreeBSD and OpenBSD).
Every year, the contributors to these projects gather at conferences such as EuroBSDCon, AsiaBSDCon and BSDCan. EuroBSDCon is organized at different places in Europe every year. Last year it was organized at Belgrade, Serbia and this year it is being organized in Paris, France. 
I have two questions regarding the visa process:
I am not sure if I should be applying for a tourist visa or business
visa. The first reason being that I am not attending this conference
on behalf of my employer. Second, I will not be doing any official
business there. So, a business visa doesn't make sense to me. But,
on the other hand almost every travel agent suggests going for
business visa for attending conferences. 
Although, I could ask my employer to support me for getting a
business visa. But the conference is organized by ""The EuroBSDCon
Foundation"", which is a non-profit registered in the
Netherlands. The business visa requirement for France says to
""submit an invitation letter from an organization established in
France"". Which is not possible in this case.
I am hoping people who have faced similar circumstances and travelled would be able to suggest me the correct way to go for the visa. 
EDIT: This is not similar to the case of an academic conference. Academic conferences are organized by Universities and attended by students, professors, researchers. While in my case, it is a volunteer driven conference attended by volunteer developers from around the world. Consider it like the various Wikipedia editors organizing a conference to talk about their work to improve Wikipedia (just an example).

Does Germany enforce a six month passport rule?,"Some countries require you to have six months remaining on your passport in order to visit.   According to this list, Germany is not among them, but this note from the US State department says ""U.S. citizens traveling on passports that expire in fewer than six months have increasingly been denied airline boarding or been detained upon arrival in certain foreign destinations, including popular European travel destinations in the Schengen area.""  This article echoes that. 
The State Department's Schengen FAQ says ""Some Schengen countries assume all travelers will stay the full three months allowed for visa-free visitors, meaning you may not be admitted unless your passport is valid for at least six months, regardless of the duration of your stay.  This requirement may also apply if you are transiting a Schengen airport for several hours en route to a non-Schengen destination.""  Is Germany one of those countries?
Assume a US traveler planning to go to Germany for a few days with a passport that will be valid for more than three but less than six months after the return flight, with the departure flight too soon to go through the routine renewal process and be confident that a new passport would arrive prior to departure.  Can the traveler wait until after the trip to do the renewal?
The Germany Page from the US State Department suggests the traveler can wait, but even that page is inconsistent about the number of blank pages required and the Embassy Messages link produces a 404 error, so the page is of questionable reliability.

Is it legal to turn high beams on when driving on a European highway with fully separated lanes?,"Wiki gives us the following explanation of the use of high beams in a car:

Main-beam (also called high, driving, or full beam) headlamps provide an intense, centre-weighted distribution of light with no particular control of glare. Therefore, they are only suitable for use when alone on the road, as the glare they produce will dazzle other drivers.

But what if you drive at night on a fully separated highway, such as the Autobahn? Are you allowed to turn on the high beams? I assume the middle barrier will prevent other drivers from getting blinded, but perhaps it would also be annoying to the drivers in the front?

Family members traveling with me: DS-160 query,"I will be applying for an F-1 student visa and I'm currently filling out my DS-160 form. My parents plan to travel with me on tourist visas. They do not have a US visa at this point however, and will need to apply for tourist visas soon. My parents have booked tickets, both for arrival and for their return. We'll be going together and they'll be returning back to my home country after some time.
I have a doubt regarding the question which asks me to state if there are other persons traveling with me. I have typed out a 'yes' since my family members will accompany me and they will return back after some time. But they do not have visas yet, and I was wondering if it is a necessity for them to take their visa interviews along with me.
I've already booked my OFC and consular appointments. My parents have not started their applications for tourist visas as yet. I am aware that a family planning to go to the US together can book a family appointment together, but since I'm not too sure as to when my parents will find it suitable to take their appointments, I would not like to book a family appointment. More importantly, I do not think that they would now get the same visa dates that I now have. Would my situation be fine?

"Barred from the US for 10 years for unlawful presence, but have been traveling in and out of the country via the ESTA waiver program","Last year I applied for my immigrant visa because I am married to an American. I was denied at the embassy during the interview because I stated that I stayed over 180 days on my previous visa which I had as a kid to follow my parents for their work. I was suppose to leave in 2005, but stayed until 2007. Therefore during my interview they told me I had a 10 year ban and had to wait to reapply. Now I am about four months from completing my 10 year ban and would like to reapply again.

"Recently naturalized American visiting UK, previously refused. Should I apply for entry clearance?","I am a very recently naturalized America citizen. I want to visit the UK but leaning towards flying in to France, and attempt entry into UK via Calais by road on my US Passport so if I am refused entry I can just go back to Paris and continue my vacation in France instead of flying direct into the UK from USA and risk being sent back to the USA directly.
I am inclined not to apply for a visitors visa ahead of time. My reason being UK visitors visa applications are evaluated purely based on documentation you mail in without having the opportunity to talk/explain to the officer, while my current plan of going physically traveling to UK would mean at the very least I will have the opportunity to petition for admission face to face.
Some background for my dilemma:
In November 2015 while a permanent resident in the USA, I applied for a simple 6 month visa to visit UK for one week and indicated I had $3500 of spending money. I was refused under V4.2E
His explanation for my refusal is I presented a Bank of America account with a balance of over $20k which shows huge deposits (of $25k plus each) and withdrawals not in line with my biweekly pay deposits of about $5k. Now of course because UK visas are purely by mail and without appeal, I was unable to explain to him those funds come from my own brokerage account. I chose not to submit a new application with additional financial documents to clarify the provenance of funds because of time, my vacation to Europe was about to start in a couple of weeks.
I have been legally resident in the USA since 1998. I am married, have a well paying job as an engineer here in the USA, have traveled several times to the UK and never stayed more than ten days. previously had two different five year multiple entry UK visas (last of which expired in 2014), visited several other countries in Europe, own my own home and am financially secure. I have never overstayed a visa in any country and travel extensively.
So basically I want to travel with all my financial documents plus copy of previous refusal as if I were applying for a visa, and present my case if questioned at entry. I assume as an American I am allowed to travel visa free to the UK, despite my previous visa refusal.
Is this better than applying for entry clearance ahead of time, bearing in mind obtaining entry clearance ahead of time does not mean I will automatically be allowed entry into the U.K.

How can I purchase Greyhound tickets online if I'm a non-American?,"I want to travel from Seattle to Vancouver by Greyhound.

As booking bus tickets in advance is much cheaper, I would like to purchase the ticket online in advance.

So, is it only possible to buy these tickets in advance if I have an American phone number?

Finally, if I understand the information at the greyhound website correctly, a Will Call ticket means that I can visit a Greyhound counter at the bus station in Seattle one or two hours in advance of my departure and get the ticket in exchange for a booking number. Is that correct?
Unfortunately, Greyhound support doesn't answer my emails, so I hope to be enlightened here :)

Personal item size: how large is the space under a seat?,"Airlines often define exactly what size and weight a carry-on bag can be, but then also allow you to bring a 'personal item' (a purse or laptop bag) of often undefined size.

I for one want to pack as much as I can without causing trouble for others, which is pretty hard to achieve with the information I have. So is the space under a seat standardized across planes?
Browsing this site and elsewhere, I can find exact specifications for some airlines, but that doesn't help much when your airline (as is my case) says:
Norwegian

You can also bring one small personal item on board. This could be a
  little handbag or a slim laptop case that fits comfortably under the
  seat in front of you.
Make sure you don't overpack!
Bulky hand bags, shopping bags or large laptop cases may not qualify
  as a small personal item. If you have too much baggage, you'll have to
  pay to check it in.

In addition to [carry-on] allowance, all passengers are allowed to bring a

Are there consequences of not taking the return leg of a Stockholm-Tallinn day cruise with Tallink Silja Line?,"Three friends and I want to do Stockholm -> Tallinn -> Helsinki -> Stockholm for a three-day weekend in January (leaving on the 13th, coming back on the 16th). The original plan is :

Now the thing is that Tallink-Silja Line offers day cruises (leaving Stockholm on the 13th, arriving in Tallinn on the 14th during the morning and leave on the 14th in the evening back to Stockholm) whose tickets are much cheaper than standard one-way tickets. For four people and the dates I provided above, a day cruise is 78€ and a regular one-way ticket is 159€ (same as a return ticket that's not on a day cruise, me thinks).
Of course, I am fully aware that we will lose the return leg of the day cruise if we choose to book the day cruise and only do the Stockholm -> Tallinn leg, and it's not a problem at all. I'm simply trying to find out if there is more to it. The Terms of Use don't really mention the issue.
Could there be consequences in buying the cheap return day cruise tickets and not taking the return leg of the journey? 
I know this question has been asked multiple times on TSE and with different carriers, but please take into consideration the fact that I also want to use Tallink - Silja Line for the second leg of the journey (Tallinn -> Helsinki): I wouldn't want to be on some sort of a blacklist or anything.

Can there be more than one UK Standard Visitor Visa stamps in a single passport?,"I already have a (now expired) 6 months long standard Visitor visa stamp/vignette in my passport.

So my main question is, for standard UK visitor visa, will the person get a new stamp/vignette each time they are given the visa or the earliest one is somehow used each time?
I am asking this because I applied for a Standard Visitor Visa again this year and received my passport back. But I didn't get any rejection letter nor a new stamp/vignette in my passport. So I was really confused if this was the mistake by the Visa and Immigration office or I am not understanding how this works.

Can I rent a car in the UK with a new driving license less than one year old?,"I'm a UK citizen visiting the UK over the Christmas period.

Can I recover anything from a non-refundable ticket?,"A few months ago I booked a flight with American Airlines. My flight departs in a few weeks from Amsterdam to Philadelphia. It's just a regular ticket I just bought from the AA website without any special things like insurances or upgrades. Because of personal reasons I unfortunately have to cancel my flight.
If I try the cancel button on the American Airlines website I get an error message saying that they are unable to process my request and that I have to call the airline if I want to cancel my flight. 
The ticket says it's a non-refundable ticket, but it also says that if it's being cancelled that I have to do it before a certain date (which I can't find anywhere on the ticket for some reason...It's a bit confusing to me) so before I make a call to the airline to cancel my flight, I would like to know if I have any right to get any money back. If so, how will I be able to get that money back? I can't find a clear answer anywhere on the website for when I want to cancel it myself, I only find my rights if it is being cancelled by the airline itself. 
So basically my question:
is there any way I get any money back when I cancel the ticket by myself?
Here's the ticket which I get when I download it from the website. The ticket I got in my e-mail is all in Dutch so I don't think it adds much value if I post that here.

Do airlines care about the expanded size on a soft suitcase?,"I consider switching to a soft suitcase. The size should be less than 158cm aggregately which I believe most airlines stipulate as the maximum size for free entrustment, but some soft suitcases, especially expensive ones like Samsonite, can usually be beyond the limit in a few cm or more.
This is especially true in suitcases that have redundant pockets on the front, which is openable without unlocking. They may also have expanders. And since the soft suitcase has more flexibility to pack into, the total size can expand more, depending on your contents. So the aggregated size can sometimes become 163 or even 168 or more, I think.
In these cases, do airlines care about these expanded size? Do they calculate the size of the baggage by the original size or by the actual, packed size?

UPDATE
Sorry if I failed to explain it well. The ""original size"" is not based on what a manufacture stipulates (which I just found written on the original post, sorry) but based on a straight line on the bag. This line would become a curve after the overloaded contents swell it up, which I meant as a ""actual size"". If the airline staff measures the baggage based on the edge of the baggage, it would be close to a perfect straight line and is considered an ""original size"".

Documents to be carried when entering UK (or any other country) on a Visa,"I note in many answers provided about 2nd visits or changed purpose, the respondents advise that you are likely to be interviewed by (British) immigration officer and should carry ALL the documents that you used to apply for your visa.
I do understand what that means but I do not understand WHY should I be carrying 6 months of payslips, bank statements, proof of property ownership etc.  
Surely the output being an issued visa assessed all of that. If I can demonstrate on entry that I have means to support myself (currency in hand), means to exit (booked return ticket) and still have a reason to visit (in my case - sister turning 60 still resident in UK) then that should suffice.
I know the argument that a return plane ticket does not demonstrate intent to leave but I fail to see how 6 months of work history and financial records will demonstrate an intent to depart that was not already evaluated. It just seems unnecessary and I have not found the site that says ""carry all the same documents for the border entry point"". Perhaps someone can guide me to that.

How to re apply?,"I have applied for UK standard visitor visa to attend my graduation ceremony for the Postgraduate course which i have completed last year. I have submitted the invitation letter from university, flight reservation, educational certificates, hotel booking. My uncle is funding my trip i have attached his banks statement and affidavit of financial support, he is funding because  i have opened bank account two months ago so according to UKVI policy banks statements should be for last six months so for that reason i have attached my statement as well to show the proof that why my uncle is funding my trip and still got rejected. Kindly please help me related to this problem and after how many days i should re apply again and what documents i should provide because my graduation ceremony will be held on 20th July 2017.

THE DECISION
I Have refused your application for visit visa because i am not satisfied that you meet the requirements of paragraph V 4.2 - V4.10.
  of appendix V: Immigration rules for visitor because:
⦁ You have applied for a visa to visit the United Kingdom for 2 weeks. I have considered your application against paragraphs V4.2 - V
  4.10. 
⦁ I note that you have previously travelled to the united Kingdom, and with your earlier application provided full details to satisfy the
  Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) at that time that you had met the
  requirements of the immigration Rules as a visitor; however each case
  must be decided on its individual merits at the time of application.
⦁ You state you wish to visit the UK to attend your graduation ceremony held on 18/07/2017 at ABC University. I note you have
  provided a letter from the University. Whilst i acknowledge this
  invite, I must be satisfied with your overall personal circumstances
  and intentions.
⦁ You state in your application you are a Voluntary/ Unpaid worker. In support of your application you have provided your bank
  statement. However the documents you have provided do not demonstrate
  you are involved in any volunteering or unpaid work and as such it is
  not clear how you are now financially supported in Pakistan. You have
  submitted a bank statement from BARC  with a latest balance of 700
  pounds. However there are a number of unexplained cash deposits into
  the account throughout which are not sourced and it is not clear where
  these funds originate from. You state your uncle will cover your cost
  of 1500 pounds towards your trip. I note you have provided a letter
  from him, a copy of passport and his bank statement. However the
  documents do not demonstrate his employment circumstances or his
  monthly income. It is therefore not clear where the 2900 pounds held
  in his bank account originate from. As such, without evidence of the
  origin of this money, i am not satisfied that is genuinely yours and
  available to fund the proposed visit. I have considered the evidence
  and information submitted in your application but i am not satisfied
  that you have accurately presented your circumstances and therefore
  your intentions in applying to enter the UK. This undermines the
  credibility of your application to the extent that i am not satisfied
  that you are genuinely seeking entry as a visitor or intend to leave
  the UK at the end of your visit. Paragraph V4.2(a) (c) (e) 
Future applications
Any future UK visa applications you make will be considered on their individual merits, however you are likely to be refused unless
  the circumstances of your application change.
In relation to this decision there is no right of appeal or right to administrative review.

I am now back in the country but without an entry stamp, and I will be leaving Salvador on an international flight at the end of the month where I have no doubt that the Federal Police will kick up a fuss about this. I am trying to decide my best course of action:

just forget about it until I'm flying out of Salvador
report to the Federal Police in Foz do Iguaçu tomorrow and explain my situation, hoping they will stamp it
when I go to Paraguay tomorrow via the Friendship Bridge, do not stamp out of Brazil or into Paraguay (the border is pretty lax), but on my way back stamp into Brazil

I should note that I would rather not have some heinous ban on reentry to Brazil, or a mark against my name to be harassed at the airport on future trips. I really did expect the bus driver to stop, and was rather shocked when he didn't - future travelers of this route beware. But I know how capricious and bureaucratic the PF can be, so I'd like to figure out how to make this right.

Does the traditional Arabic greeting (As-salamu alaykum) have religous meaning?,"There is a greeting I have often heard among Muslims. (Thanks to Geeo in the comments for helping me find the ""correct"" spelling of the phrase, which made searching for it easier):

As-salamu alaykum

To which there is a ""traditional"" reply as well:

Wa alaykumu s-salam

What do these phrases mean? Do they carry religious meaning or connotations, or are they used by non-Muslim Arabic-speakers as well? Would it be offensive (or at least out of place) if, as a Caucasian non-Muslim middle-class young male, I greeted a Muslim or Arabic speaker with this expression?

How do I select a beginner destination?,"I'm hopeful that I'm being specific enough to avoid being too broad/subjective.  I would appreciate any pointers or edits where required to make this question work here.
I am a non-road-warrior/seasoned-traveller from the North East of England.  I'm very inexperienced with regards to travel and I know very little about locations outside of the UK.  My holidays have been almost exclusively in Scotland or the lake district.  I've never been on a plane and the furthest I've ever travelled is Paris (didn't care for it - Disneyland was ok) and I'm pretty nervous about travelling in general.
My partner is somewhat different.  She loves to travel and has been to china and on a few Mediterranean holidays etc.  She's pretty adventurous and not a big worrier like me.  She'd like me to pick a destination to travel to for my 30th.
We'll have a budget of <£1800 for travel and accommodation and I can't get more than 9 consecutive days away from work.  I'd like to travel to a location that is reasonably safe (low crime rate) and friendly (accepting of foreigners), and English speaking would be a bonus.  I'd rather it take less than one day to actually get there (and the same back - so probably Europe?).  Neither I or my partner are particularly interested in a 'nightlife' or just lying on a beach for a week, and I'm not much use when it comes to activities like white water rafting etc.  Easy going hiking, seeing a bit of nature and some nice, unusual landscapes, preferably with mild-cold weather would suit us both I think (/hope).  We plan to travel in October.  I don't think I'm allowed to say 'Scotland' (again).
I'd like an answer to cover what I need to know or should consider when choosing a location; What sort of costs (particularly hidden costs) I should be aware of; and I'd very much appreciate any suggestions of countries or regions that I should investigate based on my criteria.
Update: I should have mentioned that I had considered a cruise but my partner dismissed this based on the unpleasant thought of being cooped up on a ship with lots of people (we're not very social) and having only a tiny cabin to retreat to.  A shame though because I like boats and I'm not keen on the thought of flying...  (airports creep me out)

Traveling after my German residence permit expires,"I have a question regarding the Schengen border rules. I, a Canadian citizen, entered Germany on February 1st, 2017. I got my student visa on March 3, and it will expire on June 20. However, I will be traveling in Europe (I will enter Italy on June 19 and stay there until I return home on June 29th) after the expiry of my residence permit. As I understand, the border code states that the time I lived under my residence permit does NOT count towards my 90 day limit:


For intended stays on the territory of the Member States of a duration of no more than 90 days in any 180-day period, which entails considering the 180-day period preceding each day of stay, the entry conditions for third-country nationals shall be the following:
  ...
For the purposes of implementing paragraph 1, the date of entry shall be considered as the first day of stay on the territory of the Member States and the date of exit shall be considered as the last day of stay on the territory of the Member States. Periods of stay authorised under a residence permit or a long-stay visa shall not be taken into account in the calculation of the duration of stay on the territory of the Member States.


Source: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32006R0562 
However, I don't want this to cause problems during my travels. I contacted the German visa office and they told me flat out NO (to traveling after my permit expires), saying that I have to stay out of Schengen for another 90 days. But then the rule in the border code doesn't say that. So, I need some guidance. Who do I contact from here?  
Some additional details:
- I will be entering Italy on the 19th of June (one day before my residence permit expires), and remaining there until I fly back

Is it necessary to have a confirmed itinerary for a Schengen visa application?,"I am applying for a uniform Schengen visa of up to 90 days from Spain for tourism. My point of entry and exit from the Schengen area would be Spain itself for which I would attach the flight bookings. I'll also attach the necessary hotel bookings I've made in Spain. However, in the application, it does ask me about any other Destination State(s) I would be visiting and hence the corresponding proof of accommodation. Since my plan to visit other countries other than Spain is subject to change, should I mention any other countries/bookings in the application?
Would I still be allowed to visit other countries if I get the visa?
Also, is it possible to later on change the point of entry or exit as long as Spain remains my main destination?

When will the passenger gangway at Harwich International Port be replaced?,"When travelling on Stena Line between Harwich and Hoek van Holland, there is a passenger footbridge in Hoek van Holland but not in Harwich.  Stena Line says:

Due to the replacement of the passenger gangway in Harwich by Harwich International Port all foot passenger will be transferred to and from the vessel by bus via the car deck until further notice.

When, if ever, is the replacement planned to be completed?
I've rarely seen a footbridge anywhere else than Hoek van Holland (none at Harwich, Birkenhead, Belfast, Nynäshamn, Gdańsk), and I suspect foot passengers make up only a very small part of Stena Line revenue (it has happened that we were less than 5 foot passengers in total, among hundreds of cars and lorries), so it would not surprise me if they decided to not replace it at all.
I found two relevant questions on Stena Lines Facebook page (asked in 2015 and 2016), but both are unanswered.

Schengen Visa Validity Date Mistake?,"I applied for a student residence permit for Norway and I was granted a visa that is valid for the wrong dates.

The second is the Autumn parallel which starts on September 5 and ends on December 22. All the subjects that I have been granted by the school are on the Autumn parallel period (Sept. 5 - Dec. 22) and the problem is that my Schengen visa only allows me to study for the August Block period (August 14 - September 1) since I have been granted a visa valid for July 24 to September 1 only. Could this perhaps be a mistake on their part in that they may have overlooked the dates that I will be studying in Norway? What can I do to fix it? Should I re-apply?

Why does Serbian border police not let you re-enter Serbia at the airport and then re-exit?,"I recently flew from Belgrade to Stockholm, arriving at Belgrade airport at 2AM, with the flight leaving at 6AM.
I had to change Serbian dinars to euros, and the only open bureau de change was located in the baggage claim area.
So I went through departures immigration as usual, and then tried re-entering Serbia through arrivals immigration (accessible from the departures area) with the intention of re-exiting through departures immigration.
However, the only border officer then told me that he could let me re-enter, but wouldn't let me re-exit until my flight had departed. In other words, if I re-entered, they would not let me board my flight.
Fortunately a kind airport worker offered to take my dinars with him through immigration to the bureau de change and exchange them for me, and did so.
However, this makes me wonder: why would Serbian border police do this?

What are the Fair Usage Policy (FUP) limits for free EU roaming after June 15th 2017?,"On June 15th, the EU will abolish roaming charges across all member states. However it's not entirely clear what FUP limits have been eventually negotiated: 

How much data can you use on your plan before the operator can start charging you extra?
Exactly how much is the operator allowed to charge for data once you exceed your FUP limit?
What are the equivalent limits and charges for calls and text messages?
The official EU page about roaming costs mentions that ""Roaming charges will no longer apply, as long as you are using your phone abroad temporarily"". How long is temporarily and how much will you be charged if you stay for longer?
Are there EU countries with special rules? E.g. I've read that Lithuanian operators are allowed to apply higher roaming charges to protect their market - is there a centralized page where I can learn about all the exemptions?

Links to official EU resources are highly appreciated. Kindly avoid referencing vague or unprecise statements - I assume that exact rules are already available somewhere, since the free roaming begins in 2 weeks.

Travelling to New Zealand on visa waiver while work visa is pending,"My wife (a doctor) has the opportunity to work in NZ for several months from a negotiable point in July, and as such has applied for transfer of her medical registration to the NZ medical body, and is in the process of applying for a work visa.
On an non-related basis we were planning a holiday from the start of July to NZ, and as such we already have flights booked for the 27th of June.  It just happened that the opportunity to work came up separately.
As the medical registration will take the next week to finalise (20 days to complete), and the work visa can't be applied for until that has been done, the work visa is unlikely to be issued prior to us departing for NZ on the 27th (it takes 25 days).
We are both UK citizens, and as such can travel to NZ on a visa waiver basis for a holiday visit.
We have enough funds to support a long term holiday, as we were intending on touring NZ and Australia at the same time.
We also seem to be eligible for an electronic visa from NZ, so there shouldn't be any issue with a passport being out of our possession for travel.
I will remain on my holiday visa for the duration, I have no intention to work and I have ample funds for this.
So my question is: if we present ourselves to NZ immigration on arrival with the truth (entering on a holiday visa, work visa pending, if work visa isn't issued then we are happy to carry on with our holiday, otherwise my wife will start work under the work visa) are we likely to encounter any difficulties?

I'm going to be in Rotterdam this weekend, and I was hoping to find something similar there. However, I haven't been able to find evidence of such tours there! I can find details of self-guided ones, but I ideally want to find one with someone leading a group around offering commentary, pointing out interesting things, answering questions etc.
Do such tours exist in Rotterdam? Or have I just been spoilt by Berlin and Oxford into thinking they're very common, when in fact they're perhaps a bit of an exception?

What I mean is I'm essentially doubling the chances of something happening to the bag, right?

Are there any rule changes to using a Schengen visa in an expired passport?,"I know this topic has been discussed on this forum previously, but I suppose there I might have been some latest changes. I have a valid Schengen visa, issued by the Slovak Republic, in my expired Indian passport which I wish to use to travel to Germany. I called VFS, and they said though historically it has been okay to travel with both expired and new passport. Recently, some countries in the Schengen area are recommending getting the visa transferred to the new passport or to apply for a new visa. I have the following questions:
1) Are there any recent developments in this matter?
2) Is it technically possible to get a visa ""transferred"" to a new passport? 
3) Is it possible to have a new visa while still having a valid and active one?

How can I effectively haggle for a decently-priced auto ride?,"Pretty much wherever you go in India, you'll come across 3 wheeled autos or auto rickshaws, which normally look like this:

In some places where you want to get one, there's an office or cabin where you can go, pay a small fee, and get a fixed price for the trip. As long as you can successfully communicate where it is you want to go, this gives a known low price, and you're all set.
I'm told that almost all autos have a meter, and that's how most locals handle it for shorter journeys. However, since it's fairly obvious to anyone looking at me that I'm not a local, and I'm normally trying to get an auto outside of a hotel / bar / office, they never seem to want to use the meter for me....
That leaves two options. One that should be avoided - hop in, give a destination, negotiate a price on arrival. Seriously - never do this, you'll get massively ripped off! The other is to negotiate (haggle) for a fixed price before you set off. This can give a good deal, if you know what price to start at, and how to haggle. It can give a bad deal if you don't!
What strategies can you use to ensure you negotiate a decent price for your trip?
(As an example of variability, on my first trip I paid what I thought was a good price, but turned out to be about 10 times what it should've been. Yesterday I went from my hotel to meet some friends, mid evening, and paid twice what my friends negotiated for my return at the late-night rate!)

Valid provenance of funds document for PLAB visa application,"I hope to find help here with this; my question concerns funds parking.   
I had two consecutive family visit visa refusals last year (first for lack of genuine reason for visit and, second, for failure to submit my bank statement as well as low opening account balance in sponsor's bank statements).
Now I'm going for PLAB visa and am booked for 14th Sept for PLAB 2 and I intend to submit my application in early July, say 5th. My intended date of arrival in UK is 13th August.
I have a financial organization called a Staff Multipurpose Cooperative Scheme (in my workplace; they deduct a fixed amount at source from one’s salary as instructed by the employee which he can take back as savings whenever needed or as a basis with which he can apply for a short term or a long term loan). I have been saving with them since last year; this body paid the equivalent of 2500 pounds into my account last month (this would be like 50 days or 7 weeks before my intended date of application).  
This £2500 is a little more than twice my present monthly salary. Although this amount comprises £1722 of my own total savings with the rest £777 being a loan to make up the £2500 as per my instructions. I am going to explain to the ECO that this is my savings which I had instructed the body to pay back to me at exactly this time as part of the money I had planned to add to my overall money for this trip close to my intended date of travel.   
However, my worry is that the transaction statement on my account statement added the words LTL after the amount. This is the template statement they use for all such payments to their members, so the statement was “N1,000,000 NEFT FROM XXX multipurpose scheme MAY LTL.” Since LTL is an acronym for ""long term loan"" amongst others, will the ECO figure this out?  
Secondly, what kind of document, or how will I word the document, that I can instruct this body to give me as a form of proof or affidavit to adequately prove the source of this sum of money coming close to my visa application time? 
The body says they have never had to provide any document of provenance of funds to their members so they cannot furnish me any such unless I give them a template.

I will be travelling for an undetermined duration, with a minimum of two years. (I know it can be done a lot faster, but it's about the journey, the destination is just an excuse).
We will leave in the first week of January, 2013. For various reasons, I've decided to bring my own car. So, I'll need to ship it from Europe to Canada.

Has anybody shipped a car between Europe and Canada or the U.S.?  
What kind of cost am I looking at?  
Any gotchas I need to know about?


Quick Update
I'll be shipping from wherever is the cheapest option in Europe (mainland) and shipping to the cheapest option in Canada or the U.S.

Extra Information
Many people suggested buying a car in either Canada or Alaska. But that does not answer the question I was asking : ) The car has some very nice base characteristics (very small, very good off-road ability, cheap) and in addition has special modifications for long range independent travel (such as, but not limited to, extended fuel- and water tanks) and in addition, I know this car's history so I can make an informed estimate about it's reliability. So, I've decided to bring this car. The question is now, what's the best/cheapest option to ship it.
I will likely not re-register the car in the U.S. nor Canada. I've heard from several travellers that it increases hassle if your car is registered in a different country than you live in, so, for now, the plan is to keep the car registered in my home country.

I came back to India in April because I didn't like my school there and decided to pursue a language course instead of my actual studies. I talked with my prefecture in the area and the immigration department told me that I have full right to pursue a different course. So I'm good on that side. I have two questions.
1.) Since I'd be leaving from India and will have only 2.5 months left in my student visa, will need to buy a return ticket, despite having a Long-Stay D visa? I'm asking this because some friend of mine told me that if I have less time left in my student visa, airline may ask for a return ticket. Also, I might extend my visas once I'm in France so that's another reason why I wouldn't be comfortable in purchasing a return ticket. 
2.) Will the airlines refuse to board me just for the sole reason that I don't have enough time left in my student visa?

Good destinations to travel as a family with a 2 year old,"Me and my wife are after a relatively exotic destination (travelling from the UK) with our currently 18 month year old son. We want to have a bit of a splurge before he becomes two and we'll need to buy plane tickets for him as well!
We currently have Morocco as one possible destination but are looking for other ideas. We'd like to avoid anywhere with Denge/Zika possible infection as well which narrows the options down quite a bit.
Does anyone have any good ideas?

Short term student visa to the UK,"I am a non-visa exchange student in the UK studying a course from January until June with short-term student visa. Now I am offered to stay in the UK for a second semester from Sep until Dec. The school allows me to choose from being registered as a short-term student again or a tier-4 student. And I chose to be registered as a short-term student again. 
My situation is: 
After I finish my first course in mid-June. I would leave the UK and go to somewhere in Europe, and then re-enter the UK as a visitor until September. I would leave the UK in early September and re-enter again to activate my short-term student visa. Would there be any problems if I do this way?
Also, if I choose to return home and apply for a Tier 4 visa, it is possible for me to enter the UK in July as a visitor, which is two months prior to the start of my second course. And then re-enter the country to activate my Tier 4 visa.
I have documents to prove my financial status, accommodations, school offer, air tickets, a letter stating that I need to return home to finish my degree after the seoncd course, etc. 
Many thanks!

Drinking tap water in a country where it is unsafe - anything to do after that?,"Yesterday I drunk tap water in Ho Chi Minh. I knew it is unsafe to drink it, but only after I gulped down a cup of water did I notice it was tap water. Since it is safe in my country, I just drunk it unconsciously...

What is the most comprehensive website for booking parking spots in Munich/Bavaria?,"For work purposes I need to stay in a suburban city near Munich that has very limited public transport. I am therefore using a car to get around.
Occasionally I need to drive into Munich city center and therefore need a place to park. So far I've been using a site called Ampido for reserving a parking spot, but I strongly suspect it's far from comprehensive as I've seen plenty of parking garages not mentioned there. Likewise Google Maps doesn't have a lot of parking spots. So the question is - what is the most comprehensive website for reserving/booking parking spaces in Munich?
I could obviously park on the street and pay at the parking meter, but the ones in Munich only seem to accept coins which is inconvenient. Likewise I could find a parking spot somewhere in outer Munich and take the S-Bahn, but I prefer to have a predictable place to park rather than circling around town looking for a free spot.

Does a federal security clearance allow you to bypass airport security?,"Since the implementation of TSA security checks, boarding an plane in the U.S. has become a major hassle and time-sink. It's not uncommon to wait in line for over 1-2 hours, then have to take off your shoes & belt before getting scanned and/or patted down by a TSA agent. 
While waiting in line, however, I've seen people who appear to be non-pilots or airport employees simply walk through the gate after flashing some sort of identification. And I've been told that having certain security clearances allow you to bypass the normal procedure altogether. Personally, I'd rather go through an extensive background-check process every few years than deal with the TSA every single time I have to fly somewhere for work.
In the United States, does having a federal security clearance of certain levels allow you to bypass the normal airport security process?

How to extend a visa in Shenzhen (or elsewhere),"How to extend a visa in Shenzhen (or elsewhere)
Hello,
I have some questions about extending a visa in Shenzhen. 
I have a double entry tourist visa in my passport (it is a Western European passport).
I have already used the first entry of my visa. (I crossed the border to Hong Kong and came back to Shenzhen to activate the second entry of the visa).
Now, I want to extend the second entry of the visa if possible.

Should I do it in Shenzhen or would it be better in a smaller city?
Can I just go to a hostel and ask them to sign me in and hand me a registration form of temporary residence (the pink form)?
I should be staying at the hostel/hotel the same night as I apply for the extension, right? (Not the day before).
How many days will the PSB likely extend the visa? 14, 30 or another number of days?
How many times can I extend the visa?
When is the best time to apply for an extension at the Public Security Bureau (PSB)? 10 days before expiry of the old visa? 5 days before? Or some other number of days?
Will they give me back the extended visa the same day? Someone said that the extension voids the old visa. So then it would make sense to wait for as long as possible before applying for an extension. But if it takes a couple of days to get the extension I would need to know that in advance. E. g. if it takes 7 days to receive the extension (or if it's issued on the same day).

Overstayed Fiance Visa,"In 2015, I was granted a marriage visa to Switzerland, valid from January to May. We thought that those dates were the time period in which I Switzerland and that, once I arrived, I would be allowed to remain for 6 months to organize my marriage. This was incorrect and, by the time we decided not to marry, I had already overstayed. I had flight tickets for 6 months after my arrival, in case the marriage didn't happen.  
In September, I left Switzerland and, at the airport in Frankfurt (Germany), the agent interrogated me and asked for my visa, since he saw that I stayed for 6 months. 
I explained the situation and he told me that I was in Germany and that I had violated the rules of the country.  My passport was given back to me but without an exit stamp. When I asked for the stamp, for proof that I had left the territory, he stamped it but not the part where it says in which airport. 
I wasn't taken anywhere or asked to sign anything. I asked him, if I wanted to return to Europe, would I have any problems, and he said no. 
That was nearly two years ago. Now, I want to go to Italy for two weeks and I’m terrified to be stopped. Will I have problems?
Summary:

I overstayed a fiance visa issued by Switzerland, and did not use it to get married. I left the zone from Germany where my breach was noticed, but may or may not have been recorded.

It has to have a flight number
Both airports must have an IATA code or an ICAO code
A regular person can buy a ticket - so it's not a military or government flight
The question is about flights, not planes - so it doesn't matter which plane is used on each leg

British Citizenship,"UK CITIZENSHIP
My parents and I are South African born. When I was 3 in 1961, my family left South Africa and my Dad took a civil service position in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. He thereby obtained a British Overseas (Commonwealth) Passport and in 1967, we immigrated to the UK. The children were included on my mother’s South African passport. 
Whilst in the UK, I think 1968/69, he made application at the Home Office London for separate British Travel documents for me and my Mum as I was going to proceed on a school tour into Europe. Before this was received by me however he decided to return to Africa and I am told he then my Mum was issued a UK passport with a “Right of Abode” with me again included therein.
She still travels with a UK passport with no restrictions on residence.  My younger sister also travels on a UK passport as she was born after my dad received his Commonwealth one, but she does not have the “Right of Abode”.
The question I have is would I ever be able to find out if a decision was ever taken on my application and if one was, would it be enforceable now. I currently travel on a South African passport.

Can I apply for a US visa under a different citizenship than I did the last time?,"Asking this out of sheer curiosity for now. 
I am facing the prospect of acquiring a second citizenship, and while researching the benefits of that decision I bumped into something interesting.
For my current citizenship, the US issues B1/B2 visas with a maximum validity period of 3 years (2 years in most cases). Obviously, this doesn't feel great, especially considering some African countries get 5 or even 10 years, and we only get 3.
However, for the citizenship I seek to acquire, the maximum validity would actually be 10 years!
The question is, can I legally do this? Is it ok for me to apply for a visa as a citizen of another country, if I have previously had 2 visas issued under my current citizenship? I do not intend to renounce my current citizenship, if that matters at all. Will I face a higher chance of refusal?

Is there an optimal time to check in to a Spirit flight?,"I am planning to take a Spirit flight where I have not prepaid for a seat assignment.  I will let Spirit pick my seat for me, which happens when I check in.

https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/other-north-south-american-airlines/1752373-spirit-seat-assignment-algorithm-assigned-check.html
I haven't been able to find out much else via Google...
Both times where I have checked in as soon as possible (24 hours before), I ended up with a middle seat near the back of the plane.  In the times where I waited longer (1-3 hours before), I have been able to get aisle and window seats.  Of course, this is a very small sample size, so I don't know if it has just been a coincidence or if this is indicative of how their ""random"" seat assignment algorithm works.
Question: Is there an optimal time to check into a Spirit flight to maximize my chances of getting an aisle or window seat?  If this is not possible, does anybody know if later check-ins will tend to seat me closer to the front of the plane?
EDIT: In case anybody is curious, I have two data points.  I checked in ~3 hours before a flight and ended up with 7B, which is near the front but a middle seat.  I also checked in ~16 hours before a flight and got 17F.

Resolving issues at US immigration related to a dropped driving charge,"I used to live in the US about half a decade ago now, green card holder through (thankfully terminated) marriage. During that time, I was pulled over for speeding, and then further hit with ""not using headlights"" (it was in light rain, fair enough I suppose) and ""driving without a license"".
The latter of these was dropped by the state for two reasons: 1) I was in possession of a perfectly valid EU licence, but the officer who pulled me over mistook the date at which I no longer required the (A) plate on my car, for the expiry date of the licence; and 2) I obtained a US driving licence between being pulled over and the court date.
However, since then, every time I have entered the US I have been pulled aside into what I jokingly call the ""room of people to deport"" for questioning. It takes an hour, usually more, to finally get called forward, only to spend ten seconds explaining that while I was arrested the charge was dropped, before being sent on my way.
I have since left the US, but even when I visited again I still got pulled aside.
What can I do to get to the point where I stop getting pulled aside for a dropped charge? Is there a length of time after which it won't matter, or will they actually update their records to show it was dropped, or do I have to actively do something to make this happen?

Marriage certificate when travelling to UK with Article 10 Residence Card,"I'm a British citizen and my wife is from the Philippines. We live in Spain and she has an Article 10 residence card with 'Family Member of an EU Citizen'. We'd like to visit the UK in July and she should be able to enter visa-free with her residence card as she'll be travelling with me.
The gov.uk advice page [1] says that we'll need to bring our marriage certificate as evidence of her right of admission.

I haven't been able to find any information about any requirements for the marriage certificate. We had trouble getting the Spanish government to recognise our marriage certificate when applying for my wife's entry visa + residence card (lots of crazy requirements like it not being allowed to be more than three months' old) so I'm worried that UK border control will try to impose similar requirements when trying to enter visa-free.
Does anyone have any experience or knowledge of this? Is it possible that border control won't accept a foreign marriage certificate as evidence and won't allow my wife to enter visa-free?

I've read before that foreigners could make an account, but now, for whatever reason, you need an Indian cel phone number and address (which I don't have).
I realize there was a similar question on this topic, but the marked answer links to a website with several solutions, all of which seem pretty convoluted and time-consuming. 
I would like to imagine there's some easier way of doing this. I would specifically like to know: 

Are there any American travel agencies that I could go through that will just book the rail tickets? I've contacted that Australian company mentioned in the Seat61 website, but they haven't gotten back to us.
If we just got into India, could our hotel make a train reservation for us? If so, how many days in advance would you need to book it (I'm going in July)?

Can I board if my flight arrives 1.5 hours before my UK visa becomes valid?,"My visa to UK is valid starting from June 25 but my flight to LGW is June 24 10:30 PM (edit: this is landing time not departure based on VCE-LGW flight times presented by easyjet.com). I still have 1.5 hours until my visa becomes valid. I prefer not to change my flight because I don't want to pay extra charges.

Will the EasyJet airlines going to allow me on board? I will be coming from Venice.
How long does it take from landing to Immigration in London Gatwick?
Can I stay longer in the airport before I pass through Immigration? Can I still see my luggage in the conveyor belt after 1.5 hours? How much time before they take away my luggage from the belt?

India domestic flights to carry same baggage as international flights,"I am planing to book ticket from IAH(Houston, TX, USA) to BOM(Mumbai, MH, INDIA). My final destination is AMD(Ahmedabad, GJ, INDIA).
I did this before, booked domestic flights from AMD to BOM and change airport @ BOM and then catch international flights. GoAir has policy For Customers travelling on an International flight. Its still there on their Terms and Condition Page, If you have internation flights in 24 hours of the GoAir flights, then they will carry same luggage as internation without any extra baggage charge.
But when I called customer care to verify this, they told, its there in website, but now they are not supporting that :(.
I want to know, is there any other carrier in India, which carry same luggage if we have domestic flights in 24 hours of internation flights arrival or departure?
If there is no carrier do this, then which carrier will be cheaper for domestic with luggage ?
I check online, like JetAirways charge 500 Rs per kg, and GoAir charges 250 Rs per kg.
This will be expensive for 6 bags with 23 KG each.

Discrepancies between flight comparison websites and airlines,"I have noticed an oddity comparing flight prices between flight comparison websites such as SkyScanner, Google Flights, Travel Trolley and the airlines themselves.
Often, prices for a particular route or flight are listed notably cheaper on SkyScanner than on the website of the airline operating the flight(s). This in itself is not surprising.
SkyScanner appears to search other flight comparison companies such as Travel Trolley rather than the airlines themselves, so it seems natural to expect that discrepancies between their price and the price on the airline's website result from special offers from the third party companies SkyScanner searches. Yet, when searching directly on, say, Travel Trolley, one often finds a different or higher price than SkyScanner offers through Travel Trolley. Note here that Travel Trolley appears to honour SkyScanner's cheaper price when directed through to their website.

Are these discrepancies a result of outdated data, or particular deals between various third parties that result in a complex array of prices for the exactly the same flights?
Do price comparison websites make deals with SkyScanner?
Who makes these deals? Google Flights appears to search the airlines directly and have none.
What is going on behind the scenes here that I am missing?

How to find hotels in Europe which allow for anonymous check-in?,"A few years ago I've visited a hotel in Munich and was pleasantly surprised to find there was no reception as such. To get the keys you had to call a 24/7 support line, where you received a code to a locked box outside the hotel door, which contained the key to your room. It wasn't required to show any IDs or fill out any forms. Upon checkout you simply placed the key back into the box, no questions asked.
I'm not a paranoid person nor am I hiding from the law, however I find the concept of traveling anonymously appealing. Is there a way to find out in advance if the hotel in question allows for fully anonymous check-in? And is there a website which allows you to find such lodging?

UK visa requirement: Residence or citizenship?,"On gov.uk's Standard Visitor visa page it is indicated 

Check if you need this visa if you’re visiting from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland""

“Visiting from” makes you understand that the country you regularly live in is relevant, thus you can avoid applying for a visa if you are visiting from Italy (as country of regular residency).
As a matter of fact, if you proceed to make the check, the question to answer is ""What passport or travel document do you have?"", not really consistent with the indication previously given.
So, what is relevant: the country you live in with regular documents (and where you leave from to visit UK) or the country of origin which issued the passport?
To be practical, a Moldovan who is an Italian resident with regular resident card and Italian ID card (but with the note ""not valid for expatriation"") can avoid applying for a visa if he wants to spend a week-end in London (thus visiting from inside EEA)?

"Missed night ferry on Rail & Sail connection due to delayed trains, what are our rights w.r.t. delay repay and accommodation costs?","We missed the night ferry part of our Rail&Sail connection from London via Harwich to Hoek van Holland due to a series of delayed trains.  What are our relevant rights and how do we claim those?  The detailed situation is below; perhaps too much detail but I suspect some details may be relevant so I have included it all.
The situation:

We have one ticket from the north of England to London Zones 1-6 and one Rail&Sail ticket from London Liverpool Street to Any Dutch Station.
Train into London Euston, scheduled arrival 19:14, actual arrival 19:37, 23 minutes late.
As a consequence, we missed the 20:00 departure from London Liverpool Street to Harwich International, scheduled to arrive there 21:22, with change in Manningtree (turns out this would have become 21:42).
We then took the 20:30 train from London Liverpool Street to Manningtree, aiming to take a taxi from there.  Scheduled arrival 21:33, actual arrival 22:00, 27 minutes late.  Pre-booked taxi for 22:00 had not arrived by 22:10 so we took the 22:12 train from Manningtree instead.
Next train from Manningtree to Harwich International, scheduled arrival 22:28, actual arrival 22:56, 28 minutes late.

At 22:56, no Stena Line personnel were available to assist us, so we booked into a nearby hotel at our own expense.
I fully expect that Stena Line will let us board the day ferry the following morning, but what are our rights regarding (1) delay repay, and (2) compensation for hotel costs?  Is this situation covered by CIV?

Edit: Next morning, a member of staff from Stena Line informed me that they guarantee the connection from the train if and only if people board according to the schedule recommended online.

We figured it was from a tree or plant pollinating but when we asked Italians what this phenomenon was the most we got was that its called 'polline' but nothing about where it comes from.
Which tree does this white fluff come from and is there a specifically large gathering of trees in the Lombardy region that it comes from? I would like to visit in future to see them pollinate at source.

UK Visitor visa from India. Cooling off period,"I am asking this question after reading through most of the related/relevant question-answers and I believe my query is not a duplicate. Please highlight otherwise and my apologies if it is so. 
My in-laws are in the UK now on a visitor visa that expires on 1 Nov 2017.

For this reason, I am planning to bring them back by Feb-Mar, by applying for another visitor visa. I am assuming this will be risk-free as I've heard of a certain unwritten rule of a 6 month cooling off period.
Now, my query is- is the 6-month cooling off period from the day the visitor visa expires?- in which case they can only apply for a visitor visa with a tentative travel date on or after 2 May 2018 
(or)
Is the 6-month cooling off period from the time they leave UK? in which case they can apply for a visitor visa for a travel date that is 6 months from the date they leave UK, tentatively (if they leave mid-June 2017) early Jan 2018.

How does public transit system work in Israel on the New Year (31 Dec - 1 Jan)?,"As I saw on wiki page (Public holidays in Israel), there is no holiday in Israel on 31 Dec - 1 Jan.

Travelling from Denmark to UK and back with id card,"I hold Lithuania citizenship and currently live in Denmark. Is it possible to travel to UK from Denmark and back using only the identity card?
According to gov.uk

You can enter the UK with either a valid passport or a national identity card issued by a EEA country. It must be valid for the whole of your stay.

I am fully aware that this question was asked a number of times, for example here. However, since ""Brexit"" situation might have changed. Moreover, recently while travelling from Copenhagen airport to Dublin I was asked to prove validity of my identity card using additional document (e.g. driving license).

Are official airport sites more accurate than flight tracking sites?,"My friend was saying I should stop using unofficial apps or sites to track flights as they could be wrong but don't the official site and the numerous flight tracking sites get the tracking info from the same place?  In a tracking app I was looking closely at on my phone… It said due to a FAA required delay the times in the app could be up to 15 minutes late.  Is that how it usually is?   Well 15 min behind is really not useful when you're late running through an airport. What I want to know is whether the extra time to go and check on  an ""official"" site is worth it or is it all the same tracking info everywhere?
EDIT: Side question if it's okay: the flight boards within an airport are runnng on their own internal system right?  So like their info would he accurate to the minute and beat all other website trackers
 etc. right?

Wrong surname on TGV Lyria ticket / Loopholes,"I've ( rather the autofill on my browser ) filled in my surname in place of my cotraveller's surname. Now he's got a ticket on the wrong name. 
It is a non-refundable, non-exchangable ( hence, affordable ) SNCF print at home ticket ( Which says i can reprint at the station ).
How big a problem is this? Is it likely that they'll deny us boarding? Raileurope ( from where i bought it ) give me a standard ""You'll have to book a new ticket"" reply.
Does anyone have any experience with the TGV lyria? How strictly / how much in advance do they check the ticket and ID? Having to rebook is a bit silly for such a small mistake. 
Although I'd rather not be looking for loopholes, 

Does the conductor have a copy of our names that he'll check against? 
Does the ticket at the station have our names on it?
Will we manage to get ourselves onboard before the mistake is realized? If it is and it's unacceptable, How big is the fine?

I'll probably end up booking a new ticket, but these things are ridiculously expensive without the offer we got.
Update: I contacted TGV-lyria as suggested by Tony in his answer. They replied saying """"
In general when you have printed tickets these are not controlled together with your ID-Card. It should also not cause any problem when explaining your situation to the chief on board.""""
That's enough assurance for me. Thank you everyone! :)

EC261 claim for multiple cancellations and downgrade?,"The EC261 regulations seem clear enough to me when you have a single-segment journey and your flight is delayed or cancelled.
However, while returning home with British Airways going BOM->LHR->ABZ, I had 2 cancellations across 2 different days and a downgrade!
I was scheduled to fly BOM->LHR on 28-May (in Club World), and then on to ABZ later on the same day (in Club Europe). This was a World Traveller Plus booking that I'd upgraded using Avios.
The BOM->LHR flight got cancelled, and I moved to a different BA flight around 12 hours later than the original departure. The remaining segment LHR->ABZ was also cancelled.
Now, EC261 is clear to me so far: I'm due €600 in compensation.
However, when I got to LHR I received an email telling me that the new LHR-ABZ flight had also been cancelled, and I'd been moved onto a flight the next day - and that flight had been downgraded to economy instead of Club Europe!
EC261 is clear that I should be due €250 for this, but because all these flights are all on the same ticket, I'm not sure where this stands? For me, the 2nd cancellation really is yet another major PITA, and as it occurred on a different day should be counted as a separate 'instance', so I do think I should receive additional compensation for this. But that's just what I think is 'right'; I'm not sure if that's actually how it works.
Also according to EC261, either 30/50/75% of the ticket price should be refunded when you are downgraded, but it's not clear if this applies to the whole ticket, or just the affected segment. It's also not clear if this can be claimed as well as claim(s) becauses of delays/cancellations. This downgrade is an extra unnoyance to me, as it means I miss out on much needed extra legroom, can't use fast track security (I'm only in the bronze tier of BA's Executive Club this year), and can't use the lounge.
Has anyone have any experience of something similar?
Should I submit 3 separate claims, or just one that explains everything? Or am I only going to get the €600?

How to report hotel booking fraud?,"I've booked on-line the hotel in Thailand via some agency. After I've check-out the hotel charged without my knowledge the deposit (4 times more than agency booking) and agency took the money as well, so I was charged twice. Now I can't get the deposit back as Russian agency, its partner and Thai hotel can't get into any consensus (probably the hotel doesn't won't to agree on the price). I've already called agency and hotel many times, but they don't speak English well, they're rude and they're ignoring my calls (they're always waiting for the other side), so I don't think the issue is moving forward after 2 weeks of waiting.
Where I should report the case and who to blame?

Full story:
I've booked hotel 1h in advance (The Cliff) for 1 night stay via HappyRooms (agency based in Moscow) by using Skyscanner engine and I've received the confirmation booking. I've arrived at the hotel and waited 2-3h in the reception, because hotel staff didn't know via which agency it was booked. I've called to the agency, so they've called the hotel and they talked, so hotel agreed to check me in as they said they've contacted the agency (my mistake was to fill some form giving my card details just in case). On check-out everything seems to be fine and I wasn't informed about any problems. After one week I've realised that I was double-charged (agency took £20 for the booking, hotel took £80 without my knowledge). Went to the hotel, they explained that it's deposit, until the agency will send the payment details, but I think hotel doesn't want to agree on that price (having my deposit, even more). Called to HappyRooms agency many times, they said that normally they don't deal with that situations outside of working hours (so how they're planning to solve it, if there is 4h difference). They tried to contact the hotel, but both staff didn't speak English well so they couldn't resolve the issue, so agency passed the issue to their partner Veturis based in Spain (as on the booking it's saying: ""This accommodation is booked by our partner Veturis"", ""Paid in full""). So after 2 weeks of heavy calls, the situation is: hotel doesn't respond to my e-mails or calls (for me it's 7h time difference) or saying that they're waiting for agency call, agency saying that they're waiting for their partner Veturis and at the same time they don't want to give any further details to the partner, so basically the issue is stuck since 2 weeks and it's not moving forward at all. Now I'm back to the UK.

Good movie/cinema theaters in Manhattan for sleeping through a movie?,"I have an unusual plan for spending a Sunday night in Manhattan -- I'll be busy until 11pm or so, and my flight leaves at 6am from Newark.  This means I'll likely have to leave Manhattan by 3am at the latest if I want to get there on time via public transportation.
Rather than spend a lot of money for a night at a hotel/AirBnB for just 2-3 hours of sleep, I was planning to find a movie theater with a near-midnight showing and nice seats, get a ticket for the most boring movie that is showing, put some earplugs and blinders on, and then snooze for a few hours.  If I have trouble sleeping, at least I can kill a few hours watching a movie.
I'm not sure how much of this is a travel question -- the intention is certainly travel related, but perhaps this might be better on a different StackExchange (let me know if this is the case).  I was hoping some of the Manhattan locals could give me some insight on this matter.  In particular, I would like to know:

Are there any theaters with late night showings and nice premium seats (reclining and/or comfortable)?  I've found that seating quality can vary significantly from theater to theater, and some local insight on which theaters have the best seats would be good.
Would these theaters mind if I had a backpack and a small tote bag on me?  That's all the luggage I have -- I'm just not sure what policy theaters have about how much stuff you can bring into a theater since I've never tried.

Alternatively, if someone has a better idea for how I could try to sleep for a few hours in a comfortable and safe environment, that would be good too.  A premium movie ticket should run ~$20, and I don't really want to spend more money than that.  Perhaps there are cheap and safe hostels but I've always had a negative view of hostels... (EDIT: Also, the sound of someone else snoring really bothers me when I'm trying to sleep.  I'd much rather have background movie noise than someone snoring.)

However, what's not so well known is that it's possible to book a flight with a mainline or regional carrier in the US and end up on something like one of these (picture by CFIF @ Wikipedia):

As you can tell, there just is no place for an overhead compartment on a plane that small.  This raises the question: what happens to your carry-on bags?  Do you gate-check your main carry-on and carry on your personal item? Are you required to gate-check your personal item as well?
Furthermore, when flying on a plane that small, are there general limitations on luggage that are not imposed by larger aircraft, such as weight or size limits?

"Indian Passport not stamped, arriving from Canada via Amtrak","I was travelling back on the Amtrak train to New York from Montreal after a 3 day stay. On the way back, the CBP officer didn't even check my passport. Neither did he check the passport of the person sitting next to me and ahead of me. 
What should I do about this if anything? I have an entry stamp in my passport for Canada, but no entry stamp for USA. 
I checked my I94 on the website, and it says I entered on 4th April and exited on 27th May, but no entry for today(29th May).
Edit:
If it helps, I'm here on an F-1 visa.
Update:
I called the CBP office at JFK aiport(the number for Philadelphia airport is unreachable) and they said that since my stay in Canada was just for 2 days my old I94 is still valid and that I didn't need to do anything about it.

Can I use a I-571 (Form I-131) Refugee Travel Document and my national passport at the same time for convenience?,"I am a permanent resident based on asylum, a green card holder, citizenship is Russia. I was advised not to use my national passport with the US immigration as it may signal my willingness to accept benefits of the country from which I was granted asylum in the US. I currently possess a valid Russian passport.

When I want to go travel to a certain country that has a visa waiver for Russian citizens, would it be okay to present the Travel Document on the way out of the US and enter the destination country on the national passport?
If I decide to travel to a country for which I need a visa as a permanent resident asylee, would it be okay to travel to neighboring countries presenting the national passport to avoid receiving visas as a Russian citizen and subsequently return to the US from the country of the initial arrival presenting the Travel Document upon arrival to the US?

Details for Q2. The nature of the question is about a potential issue of not having all of the arrival/departure stamps in the same document. To clarify, I do not intend to travel to Russia. To paint the picture better, let's say my itinerary is USA, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, USA. A visa would be obtained only for Thailand and placed in the Travel Document.
Note: this is related to I have two passports/nationalities. How do I use them when I travel? but not the same as in this case there is one passport and one nationality.

RyanAir Flight Pooling My Own Baggage?,"I'm flying with Ryanair on Thursday and I bought the leisure plus which already includes one checked bag of 20kg but since I am moving back home I had to book another 2 checked bags of 20kg.

Arriving Before Visa Start Date,"Reading this thread got me thinking about what would happen if you unintentionally arrived early in a country (specifically port or airport - if it's by road just hang tight a mile or two from the border!) for which you required a visa?
For example, a flight that was due to arrive at 1am in the destination country caught a strong tailwind and arrived at 23:30 the day before. Does anyone have experience of this?
Similarly for unintentional overstays - I have had a flight delayed 12 hours (3pm scheduled, 3am +1 day actual departure) where we were bused from the airport to a hotel in Lisbon. If I required a visa to be in Portugal at the time and was leaving on the last day of its validity, how can that be handled? Doing exit passport control 4 hours before the flight?

Is there a way to NOT have my bags automatically pass thru at a plane change?,"I'm considering traveling LAX >---> SYD >---> DPS (Indonesia) in a few months.

It's a 15 hour flight followed by a 6 hour flight with less than 5 hours between and I've had problems with DVTs in both legs and PEs in both lungs just 3 years ago, so I'm leery of spending that much time (20 hours) in a plane over a 26 hour span.

Is it common for flight insurance bought from an airline to be only valid for citizens from the country of the airline?,"Looking at buying tickets for an international trip, I noticed the optional insurance section contained the text 'The insurance is valid for Russian citizens.' (its a Russian airline)
It sounds as though there is no point purchasing this as a non-Russian citizen but it seems odd to me as the airline flies internationally a fair bit so a large portion of their customers must be non-Russian. Additionally, the option to purchase the insurance appeared and was even selected by default, even though I had already selected my nationality as not Russian previously.
Is my understanding that there is zero value to me purchasing the insurance and if so, is this limitation common?

"What is meant by ""personal impact and articulation skills"" in the context of border entry?","Within dozens of highly-rated responses regarding both UK and Schengen entry, I see the phrase ""personal impact and articulation skills."" 
There is no further explanation of what these mean and, in many circumstances, appear to be important, or vital, to successful outcomes. Can these be defined, quantified, expanded, and exemplified?
For the most part, the queries originate from those who don't require an entry clearance, many from US and Australian citizens, although not exclusively.
Tymoteusz Paul suggested that, in requesting temporary admission: 

More than any other factor, the outcome of an event with a British Immigration Officer is influenced by personal impact and articulation skills.

Joel Damien explained to the student whose visa was expiring and wished to leave and re-enter as a tourist

This is entirely up to the Immigration Officer who lands you (if he does in fact land you). For both cases you will need a convincing reason why you are showing up after your course of study has ended. You can expect to be asked this question during your landing interview and the outcome will depend upon the plausibility of your answer along with your personal impact and articulation skills.

And Gayot Fow's guidance to a non-EU citizen who works in Germany but still has a valid UK residence permit and ask if he may enter using it:

Depending upon your nationality and other soft factors (personal impact and articulation skills) you may be successful with that.

The author of many answers, whom I queried, recommended opening the discussion among all TSE users, toward broader understanding and content when such terminology is used. 
Personal impact: what is it, how is it accomplished, what are the positive and negative traits?
Articulation skills: what does that mean, what are better or worse, what traits are preferable or more successful?

UK VISA post submission anxiety,"With reference to UK Visa, I have just read about 'post-submission anxiety' and find I am suffering the same. 
My wife and I were invited in March 2017 to attend brother-in-law’s 60th function taking place in Bristol in July 2017 in Bristol. We went through various stages of what will it cost, how much spending, how much leave required, etc. and my initial conclusion was hold off till 2018. My logic being that I did not want to do that trip with only 14 days of leave. I wanted a longer visit.
In May 2017 we had in South Africa a family reunion at Mum’s home in Pretoria, and my baby sister resident in Australia, advised that she had applied for her visa for the July 60th in the UK. My wife then said ""apply for me (herself)"". 
We went to the visa application form and guidelines and I said to her if you're going make it a two month visit, it is summer go from 15 June till end August. We duly completed her visa application. She then asked if I did not want to apply as well, which I did just in case using the same dates.
The next day I asked at work about taking some unpaid leave and was advised that it was not possible as my colleague had booked leave from mid-July to mid-August already. I was granted leave for the period 26 June till 15 July. I advised my wife that she should proceed to book for herself, but she sought flights and booked the both of us on flights to UK 26 June 2017 returning 12 July 2017.
We booked visa appointments and I read the requirements for submission. I read and understood we need to demonstrate proof of income and evidence that you can maintain oneself and that this was either a bank statement or payslips and hence we submitted for myself:
•   Letter from employer stating, date employed from in 2010; that leave had been applied for and granted, and that I was expected back at work 17th July; and residential address as we reside in company provided housing
•   Separate letter from employer payrolls advising of my monthly Total remuneration Package accompanied with 6 months’ payslips attached. 
•   Also I am in receipt of an investment pension so I included and investment statement and 6 months’ payslips, which shows our medical aid deductions
For my spouse who is not employed but who receives rental income, we included:
•   6 months bank statement showing the rental income and property title deed in both our names for the property for which the rental income is derived
For both we included:
•   Proof of purchase of return air tickets
•   Proof of purchase of travel insurance for the same period (letter to embassy from insurer)
•   Invitation sent inviting us to the function stating occasion, date and the address
•   Email from my sister, providing address and contact number, stating that if we arrived she would see to our accommodation as well as provide us with access to a motor vehicle
And then while waiting post submission I started reading “reasons for refusal” and have become very concerned about if I should have included my own bank statement as well. I clearly understood from the guidance that it was an either or option to prove income; it states “such as bank statements, six months’ payslips” etc. but not a necessity. The only necessity was the passport. As I await this decisions as the documents are now with UKVI for decision I am now suffering from the 'post-submission anxiety'. Is it warranted? Can I /we be refused for the lack of my bank statements? Would the dates given for being in the UK on application from 15 June to end Aug being different to the ticket from 26 June to 12 July be an issue?

She is coming to the UK to visit me this summer for 1 month and later in the year I want to go and stay with her in the US for 85 days. During this time, we will be staying with her parents at their family home and I should have between £4,000-5,000 saved.

How likely is it that I will be turned away and not allowed to enter the US? I really cannot afford for this to happen because I would love to marry this girl and she has told me time and time again that she would prefer to live in the States, so it looks like I will be moving there if we do marry.
Also, what would happen if I was to be turned away at the border? As I understand, it would ban me from using the visa waiver programme again.

How can a kid fly with one parent and return with the other?,"I have a plan to fly with my kid to my parents (CDG-FRA) for the sake of example), leave the kid there for a couple of weeks and then let my wife do the same flight and bring the kid back.
If I were to be on both flights, that wouldn't be a problem: I could book a round trip for myself and the kid for the whole duration of the holyday (CDG to FRA on day D and return on day D+14), and then just book a round trip for myself in the opposite direction (FRA to CDG on D+1 and return on D+13). However, I will be busy on D+13, so I wonder if my wife could fly instead, without booking super-expensive one-way tickets for every flight.
What options do I have?

Do you clear immigration in Hopa? If so, where?
When clearing immigration at Atatürk and (if at all) Hopa, do you get stamped in/out, given that you have to show your boarding pass? In other words, do I get an exit stamp on the migration card at Atatürk, and get a new migration card with an entry stamp in Hopa?

Question about Spouse Visa (UK),"Little background history - I am born and bred within UK, London so have a British Passport. My girlfriend (tier 5 visa from Hong Kong), whom currently lives in London has her working visa expiring in late September this year. Of course we would both love to live together and have many talks about getting married however there are a few complications which need some answering.
First of all how long would the application for the spouse visa take and what criteria will we need to satisfy in order to  complete the application? We don't currently live together, will this impact the application? We work together, have numerous, countless pictures together since January 2016 if it helps.
Also my other half needs to go back to Hong Kong to attend two of her friends wedding as well as visit her very sick grandmother during the months of November 2017 to around February 2018. If she was to get the spouse visa before her working visa expires would this short trip back to her motherland jeopardise anything in the long haul of her application? From what I read, under 6 months will not greatly impact anything however at at UK border control they will ask her questions. After February she wants to fully settle down within the UK hoping to acquire citizenship after 5 years as well.
If there is any additional information which is needed in order to answer these questions do let me know. Any help will be greatly appreciated!

Non-EU spouse may not get Schengen Visa in time,"This might end up a long post but please bear with me, I'm hoping you guys can provide some advice.
Some background info, I'm an Irish national and my wife is Chinese and we both live in the US (married in the US and Green Card holders). We are going to Spain, Portugal and France for 2 weeks flying on June 30th, my good buddy is getting married in Portugal.
Back in January my wife went to the French consulate to get the Schengen Visa. The french consulate employee went through my wife's docs. During the appointment, he noticed a small rip in her passport, made a joke about it but didn't seem fazed. So he approved the visa application, stamped her passport and went to send it off to the back office for the visa before he noticed we are not travelling until June and said it was too soon and that she should come back closer to travelling. So we were lead to believe coming back would be a formality.
Last Friday, my wife returned to the French consulate and when she sat down with the same French Consulate employee, he refused the application because of the rip on the passport!! And told my wife to get a new passport. My wife was pissed. That rip in her passport was been there for years, she was able to get an Irish and UK tourist visa, Japanese tourist Visa, got a US green card, traveled back and forth to Ireland, UK, USA, Canada, China, and Japan with no issues. So we were shocked that the visa was refused, especially after being accepted initially. The passport rip has not changed or got worse since the initial appointment.
My wife straight away set up an appointment with the Chinese consulate in NYC but the earliest date she could get was June 8th and it takes 15 business days to process so we could only get her new Passport back on June 29th and were are flying the 30th, so we could end up with no time to get the Schengen Visa. The French Consulate employee said we could come back to him and get the visa in 2/3 days which might be too late. We are hoping we can the Chinese consulate can get it done in less than 15 days.
My wife went to the Spanish consulate today but they wouldn't process the visa because France is our main destination.
We have a French Consulate appointment on June 21st where we plan to go most likely without the passport and just meet with them to tell them the issue and ask them how can they help us last minute as the passport could come in any day leading upto June 29th.
I don't know what options we have now if her passport doesn't come until June 29th.

Is it even worth our while trying to board the plane to Spain on
June 30th if my wife doesn't have the Schengen visa? Is it going to be a lot of hassle hoping for a long shot of boarding the plane and not being refused at the border?
Does the fact that she has a valid UK and Ireland tourist visa matter? Could we change our flights and stay in Ireland for a night, then fly to Spain?

What were the indefinite validity visas that used to be issued by the US before VWP was created?,"According to the State Department:

Indefinite validity visas (Burroughs Visas) are tourist/business visas manually stamped into a traveler’s passport which were valid for ten years. Effective April 1, 2004, all indefinite validity Burroughs visas became void. Therefore, if you have an indefinite validity visa you must apply for a new visa for travel to the U.S.

This seems like a curious type of visa and certainly a big luxury compared to the modern VWP system. My questions are:

Who was eligible for the indefinite visas?
Was it really possible to stay in the US for whoever long you want while they've existed?
Why was the system scrapped?
Why were they named ""Burroughs"" visas?

Does Heathrow Terminal 5 allow transit visa exempt flyers to stay airside overnight?,"I have found lots of evidence online that Heathrow is not closed overnight and that passengers without a visa who are transiting through the airport can hang out overnight on the air side to catch their connecting flights the following morning.

Between 11:30pm and 6am Heathrow is restricted by the Government to
  5,800 night-time take-offs and landings a year. There is also a night
  quota limit, which caps the amount of noise the airport can make at
  night. Around 80% of the night flights at Heathrow are between
  4.30-6am with on average around 16 aircraft are scheduled to arrive each day between these hours. Heathrow also has a voluntary ban in
  place that prevents flights scheduled between 4:30am-6am from landing
  before 4:30am. We also do not schedule any departures between 11pm and
  6am.

How can I determine if I'll be staying on the same plane or switching planes during the layover?  Is there something in the flight description that lets me know there's no switch?  Or do I have to call the airline to learn this?
I prefer to avoid very short layovers, but a short layover on a flight I'm already on is fine.

What should I mark as the purpose of my trip to the Schengen area if I have multiple different activities planned?,"I will be travelling to France for an academic conference and then to Spain after that for tourism.   For the academic conference, I believe that I need a business visa issued by a French consulate.  My question is, can I travel to Spain with the same visa?  If so, when filling in the Schengen visa application form, which box should I check in line 21, main purpose(s) of journey?  Should I check business or both business and tourism?

Standard Visitor Visa refusal grounds V 4.2 (e) (opacity),"I applied for UK visa 3 weeks back and today I collected my documents. My application has been refused with following reason:

Is there a website to find points to get tap water at airports?,"We now have two questions about drinking water taps/fountains in airports, but they are very specific, one to one the terminal of a single airport, the other as wide to cover both airports in a smallish city.
This, and some banter about it on the chat, inspired me to ask this question.  
Most of the time I travel with a water bottle, to fill after going through security, and I do prefer not to buy bottled water. That is more a principle than a money choice, but the inflated prices for water in some airports do make the money side more important, added to which comes the fact that when you have a stop over you do not always have local money and paying for water on a credit card is a bit over the top.

Water fountain at the Chiang Kai Shek International Airport in Taiwan, by PhiloVivero under Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported
Are there any websites known to include water fountains in their information about airports?
Either actual tap points or the fact that gettting water is hard (no taps or fountains, ask in restaurant,) or easy, (like Schiphol, Amsterdam Airport where there seem to be drink water fountains near every other toilet group,) or general for the country with added information that the airport is not better (do not drink tapwater in this country, there are no special drink water fountains on the airports.)
It would be a bonus to be able to see if it is acceptable to ask at an airport business to fill up your bottle, or even just a bit to take you medication, even when you do not spend money with them.
I am thinking sites like the one where you can find overnight/sleep qualities of different airports.
After a few months with no real responses, I give up on this question.
Even drinking water points that were there seem to disapear, like on Schiphol, Amsterdam Airport. (Were I was told the water in the basins at the toilets is drinking water quality and has cold as well.)

The only problem I had was while boarding the connecting flight from Muscat, where I showed them my emails from the embassy and the airport/transit hotel and they agreed to let me board. 
I chose an earlier flight because I was saving (overall) a pretty penny - Yes it was incredibly risky and no, I don't recommend it.
If you do find yourself in my situation though, be sure to confirm your plan with all parties - embassies, airlines, hotel etc. And keep ALL email printouts as proof to show in case of a problem.

Holiday Inn - charge for cancelled reservation,"Last night I booked a room for next weekend in a Holiday Inn.  This morning, I got word that my event was moved, so I cancelled the Holiday Inn and booked a room in a hotel closer to the event. I just realized that Holiday Inn will charge me for the first night, as part of the cancellation.  
This is on me -- I'm pretty sure they gave warning both when I booked and when I cancelled, and I just didn't pay close enough attention because I was in a rush (and because I'm used to hotels that allow cancellations up to a night or two beforehand). Still, is there anything I can try to get the charge removed?  Has anyone had any success with this?  
Update To update: I phoned the hotel, and got transferred, transferred, and transferred again to a nice lady called Holly, who tried to put me on hold and accidentally disconnected me, but promptly called back, all apologies, and put me on hold for a long time, while (she told me) she got transferred three times, until she finally got a gentleman who looked it up and said that, in spite of the clear message in my email, I was not actually charged the cancellation fee. So I thanked Holly very much, and now we will see if that is actually true.  (update again It was true and I wasn't charged.)

By the way, the visa that I used to go to the US was single entry B1 visa with an annotation that the purpose of my travel was to take the exam. I am anxious that I might be refused another visa, because I have been refused once already.I was denied the first time before I went to US.I was applying to take the October 27 2015 exam to CA but the consul asked me if I have relatives in the USA.I honesly said ""yes"". The consul stood still for a while as if he was having a second thought of giving me the visa.He said "" excuse me for a minute"" then he talked to someone else then when he came back he said he can't give me the visa.He advised me to just instead take the exam on Guam or Hawaii.Maybe that's why I wasn't denied the next time I applied to Hawaii.My reason for staying almost the entity of my visa is because I had to take another exam on July 19 2016.I am not currently petitioned by anybody to migrate in the US.Way back we were petitioned(whole family) by my uncle but by the time our petitioned was approved I was already 26 so I couldn't go with them.

Extending stay in US by a day with business visa on client invite letter,"I got an invite from our client in the US to visit them for a ""week"" as per invite letter. This is on a business visa. My brother is there in the US and he is around 800 miles from the place where I am going to. In the invite letter, it is mentioned that I am being invited for a week at their premises for discussions. I am supposed to return on the next day (Saturday) flight. If I extend this to Sunday, I would be able to spend a day with my brother and his family, and can come back to the same airport to board a plain back to India.
Can someone advise on the legalities of this? I know that on a business visa, one can stay for 45 days in US, but the client invite letter says that it is for a week. Please advise. Also is it okay if I spend some personal time around to visit my relatives? Sorry if it sounds silly.

"Entered the US by land, left by Mexican land border. Had a flight booked but didn't take it. Will I have problems entering the US again?","I am a European citizen under the visa waiver program. I flew the US from London and had to purchase a ticket out of the US to be allowed to board the plane there. Found a cheap ticket to Guatemala from Texas.
I told the border guard that I was taking that flight out of the country. But I ended up crossing the Mexican land border instead and traveled onward to Costa Rica and then back to the EU. 
So there is no record of me leaving the US (Except for the Mexican stamp in my passport).

What point on the main land of The Netherlands is furthest away from any buildings?,"Living in The Netherlands, I know my country is a crowded one. I typically can't leave a town for a couple of steps before arriving in the next one. So I was wondering,
Where in The Netherlands am I furthest away from any city or town?
I know that the Wadden Islands group of Rottum is a pretty good contender, but I want to limit this to the main land, where you could actually walk for a mile or so — neither of the islands is big enough for more than a stroll.
Also, there's of course a difference between the built-up area of a town (""bebouwde kom"" in Dutch), and other buildings such as farms. Ideally, I'd like to see both points of view addressed: where am I farthest away from regular towns, and where am I farthest away from any building it all?

Where can one experience hot springs in Yellowstone National Park?,"Ok, let me start with the obvious. No, you cannot go swimming in Grand Prismatic Spring or any other geyser in Yellowstone National Park.  While it is indeed illegal, the truth of the matter is that most of the natural geothermal features of Yellowstone are just a few degrees shy of boiling water, subjecting the would-be bather not just to federal law, but the law of physics, and near certain death :)
That said, I distinctly remember that in Yellowstone, there are some places in the rivers that you can actually swim and experience a hot springs like effect.  Where the runoff from the geothermal features meets the river (like Firehole), the mixture can be quite pleasant.
I am bringing my kids to Yellowstone in August, and I want to take them there.  Unfortunately, within my books, I can't seem to remember where one can do this.
To the best of my recollection, on the way up from Norris to Mammoth Hot Springs, there is a place where you can pull off on the side of the road and get in the river, where the runoff from a hot spring naturally warms the river.  Does anyone know the name that I could google to do more research?

US visa granted before VWP. Will I need a US visa now?,"I'm an ex-pat British Citizen living in New Zealand. Many years ago (c1987), before the days of the Visa Waiver Program, I went to New York for a short business trip (about 10 days), and was granted an indefinite visa. 
I've never had reason to go back, and obviously, in thirty years my passport has expired and been renewed several times. I'm not sure I could find the one with the visa in now.
I may need to visit the US for family reasons sometime in the next year. It'll only be a short visit - 2-3 weeks - and I'll be returning home to New Zealand, either direct, or via the UK.
Based on a sketchy understanding of US immigration rules, if I've had a visa before, I'll need one again. However, as a UK citizen I would otherwise qualify for visa-free entry. 
Should I try and get my visa reissued for my current passport? Should I apply for a new one? Or, given that the VWP didn't exist when my visa was granted, can I now just turn up and enter under the VWP?
I should probably stress that there are no complexities here. My original visit went exactly as planned, and my proposed visit is just to visit family - a holiday.

Which is the correct country to apply for Schengen visa?,"Travel questions regarding my partner (a South African national residing in the U.K.).
We have two holidays planned in very short succession from each other. The first is to Country A from the 15th June until the 20th, 5 nights. From there we would travel back to the UK before flying to Country B on the 29th June, where we would remain until we fly to country C on the 6th of July before returning home on the 11th.
This makes 5 nights in country A. Return to country of residence then a second separate trip with 7 nights in country B and 5 nights in country C.
We initially thought that country B was the correct country to apply to, as this is where the longest stay would be in the period of the visa. Although they responded to our booking request, we were told that it was country A we need to apply through, as we would be returning to the country of residence between our trips. Upon receipt of this, and with time beginning to dwindle, we booked an appointment slot with country A and forwarded the query to double check. They today have said that they are not who should be dealing with it, and it is, in fact, country B.
Any ideas? At the moment it is looking like we can only apply through country A and hope they don't reject it, as country B has been refusing. We are considering just visiting country A and C so that the visa appointment we have will be successful, although we really don't want to have to do this.

How to get updated about current incidents and safety concerns?,"Yesterday there was an explosion at a hospital in Bangkok (which is where I'm located), and it didn't come to my attention until a relative in my home country sent me a link to an article in a local online newspaper.
I have some Google Alert's set up and an RSS Feed to my Foreign Ministry's ""alert"" feed, but those aren't 100% perfect. For instance, the Google Alerts give so many false positives that they're becoming annoying, and the RSS Feed only seems to cover really major events.
Of course, local newspapers in Bangkok have their own RSS Feeds as well, and these will often be the first ones to report on an event as it is happening. But the problem is that the same story is often covered many times, resulting in a lot of unnecessary updates. And filtering out irrelevant events is usually not easy, so you'll just end up with too much information, which is just as bad as no information...

She was already here for 5 months, went home for a month, and then was coming back to use my place as a ""base camp"" as she went travelling back and forth to mainland europe. When she got to immigration at the Eurostar the UK border control didn't let her through and did biometrics on her and a 2 hour interview. Now she is stuck in France but her passport doesn't say how long she can stay there and we need to know how she can enter the UK, what type of visa doses she need if she has been refused entry?
Thank you in Advance!

"Are there sources in Prague that have hand-held, printed maps?","For my bucket-list trip to Prague/Praha and with an architectural history background, I want to make the most of my time in this City of a Thousand Spires.
I prefer to wander throughout a city, get its sense of place, feel its soul and its history. My navigational gene wants to orient me, and let me understand through the use of with maps and street guides.
And I would like to do it without digital assistance, as it narrows my focus to an app on a mobile device. While I do plan to use an app, I'd like to have printed versions of good walking and transportation maps, and am especially interested in what might be obtainable locally.
Are there for sources in Prague that have hand-held, printed maps? If available, it would be useful to have sources for printed guides/maps of transit options, both under and above ground and those that indicate taxi stands. It would be handy, although not a requisite, to find maps that can be mounted on a bicycle/scooter to navigate as you go.
And, as a side note, on return home, the printed map is very useful in identifying the thousands of images taken.

How to tip a concierge or a hotel porter?,"Tipping in a restaurant is simple enough, you give 0-20% depending on country, city and how good the service is. You are already handing someone money, so saying keep the change, or ask for 10 euros back instead of 15 is easy.
Tipping for services that don't include money in the first place feels awkward to me. I feel like I'm giving pocket money to a kid, and I feel like I'm insulting them.
How would you tip a hotel porter, a concierge our someone else, where money is not already in the mix? Do you just take a few euros from your wallet and hand it to them?
Note: I'm not asking about how much I should tip, I'm asking about how I should do it, and what I should say when doing it.
Although this question is a general one, I might mention that I'm in Italy at the moment (where tipping is not as common (or expected) as in the US).

Flights within Australia allowed on a subclass 400 visa? Is there a more suitable visa for me?,"I am currently in Australia on a subclass 651 visa. I am planning to leave for two weeks to go to NZ and apply for a subclass 400 visa so I can do work for my company in the UK. I want to do some travel while I am doing work in Australia - see Sydney, Melbourne, Uluru etc.
One of the provisos on the visa - 
""If you are granted a single entry visa, you will only be allowed to enter Australia once. If so, you will need to apply for a new visa if you want to return to Australia after you leave.""
This implies I would be safe traveling within Australia on this visa then correct, since I wouldn't be re-entering...or would I potentially have a lot of headaches here ? 
Also, is this even the right visa? I am working for my company in the UK, and will be paid in the UK only. I do not satisfy this requirement :

whether (with an inevitable layover in LAX or similar) I will be charged for my flight containing both a domestic and a transpacific component, and so 
whether it would cost more to organize a stopover in Portland (PDX).

Can a non EEA spouse have two Schengen visas (family and tourist)?,"I went to Italy with my husband last year (he is British and I am Indian and we live in the UK).

Therefore I wanted to ask whether it's more viable to scratch that plan altogether and instead focus on railways and other public transport to go from place to place. The only obstacle I see in this plan would be that this might ""skip over"" interesting sights along the way, since you cannot just make a small detour along the way.

Can airport security in Israel force me to provide my access credentials to laptop or online accounts?,"I've read that going through airport security at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport can sometimes be a nightmare. Being asked a bunch of questions and having someone going through your every single item, in a room away from your sight, appears to be normal.
In some cases, passengers are asked to strip so they can take their clothes somewhere else to be checked (for what, I do not know). What worries me the most is that some people have been forced to provide their access credentials to their devices (laptop, tablet, smartphone) and certain websites (facebook, gmail). I also read a comment in a blog post where a woman claimed the airport security placed a computer in front of her and ordered her to login into her facebook account, and then made fun of her photos (I cannot find the post, I believe it has been deleted).
I would dislike being stripped searched but I can live with that. However, providing my access credentials to my electronic devices or email account, for example, is something I'm 100% against. It is a gross invasion of privacy. I have nothing to hide but that does not mean I want someone going through my stuff. Not to mention that once they access my device, usually out of one's sight, I have no guarantee they did not install a rootkit.
I'm traveling to Israel for a few days on business. My laptop is full of work-related data whereas my phone does contain private data (photos, messages, phone numbers).

Multiple flight changes - any risk?,"My wife is helping out with a family member who has some medical issues in another city in the United States (halfway across the country).  Initially she planned to go for only two days, as it wasn't clear what the situation was, but when it became clear it was more serious we rebooked her flight (on Southwest) for a few days later.  
Now, it's become clear she needs to stay yet another few days, and I'm rebooking her again.  So far this hasn't caused any problems - there are a few flights a day between our airports and one always seems to be the same price as the initial one - but I'm wondering if there are eventual consequences for rebooking flights quite a few times, especially with only a day or two's notice each time. 
I don't see anything regarding limiting rebookings in the contract of carriage, but I'm really asking from a more general sense: is this likely to cause issues in the future, either with security, with the airline, or anything else I'm missing?  Should I do anything to let Southwest know why we're making these changes (as they're related to a medical situation)?

Is there a way to check that the conditions on your plane ticket are actually what your travel agent said they are?,"When I buy my plane tickets there's often certain things I want such as:

Ticket valid for 12 months
No fee for return date changes
Stopovers in both directions

Now it seems that these days your E-ticket is basically a number. So you get an itinerary that your travel agent prints out with your E-ticket number, some other reference numbers, and some, but not all conditions of your ticket.
From what I know of air tickets there are all manner of codes for all kinds of conditions, including things like in my list above, but they are vastly complicated and don't necessarily map directly to the simple English phrases I used.
My question is How can I check that the ticket I bought actually does have all the things I asked for? What if the agent made a mistake or a wrong assumption or printed the wrong thing on my printout. It's not a printout the airline made after all.
I made sure when booking my ticket to ask multiple times on each point. But I didn't get the agent to put it in writing and sign it.
What just happened:

My printout says my ticket was valid for 12 months but when I called the local airline office to change the date they didn't think my ticket was valid for a year after all! (It turned out it was a year ticket after all this time.)
My printout says date changes will cost $75. But the local airline office told me changes are free! (This time luck is on my side.)
My travel agent only booked my stopover on the way to my destination and not the one on my return flight. They assured me I can change it while I'm travelling with no problem. But the local airline office tells me it's not so simple after all and if it's even possible it will require some fees! (This time luck may be against me.)

Travelling to the US on the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to attend a job interview,"I am a UK citizen who has been invited to the US for the purposes of an onsite interview in a few weeks' time. I have been looking online for an answer to this question and have found many conflicting reports (for examples of such differing opinions google terms like 'vwp job interview' and read the many answers).
While applying online using the ESTA form I came across this question (emphasis mine):

D) Are you seeking to work in the U.S.; or have you ever been excluded and deported; or been previously removed from the United States or procured or attempted to procure a visa or entry into the U.S. by fraud or misrepresentation?

There is no additional context to this question such as 'on this visa' and so looking at it objectively it seems that the only correct answer in my scenario is to answer 'yes' - I am seeking to work in the US, albeit in many months time if and when the company a) offers a job and b) acquires an appropriate work visa.
Clearly answering 'yes' to this question is the 'wrong' answer and looks very much as if it would result in a rejection. I do not wish to answer 'no' and be seen as having lied due to the above reasoning (especially if asked at the border what the intention of my trip is - the truth is that I am there to attend a specific interview and leave).
I'm asking here because I cannot find anywhere official that states whether this scenario counts as 'seeking to work in the U.S.' or not. I have only found several people across the web who are utterly convinced of their own reading of the phrase 'seeking to work' and their implicit assumption of non-existent context in the question.
The company in question now tells me I need a B-1 visa instead which I have begun the process for, however I am not convinced yet that this is required for my situation, considering my trip will be 2-3 days only. I have tried emailing the Embassy in London but it will be a few days before I potentially hear back.
EDIT: After reading links in the comments, an additional question is in regards to the difference between the B-1/B-2 and the VWP - does a B1/B2 visa offer anything regarding job interviews to the holder aside from more time in the US (which in this scenario is not an issue)? This pdf for example does not include mention of a job interview and is linked from this VWP page giving the impression that the two paths of entry are functionally the same in terms of business travel. If anyone knows of an official statement regarding the visa to use for pre-arranged job interviews then this would be extremely useful.
UPDATE: I have received an email response from the London Embassy. They state:

If you are travelling to the United States exclusively for an interview or meetings, you may do so on a B-1 business visitor or visa-free under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) if you are otherwise eligible. Please be aware that you are not permitted to undertake any work on a B-1 visa or the VWP and must obtain the relevant work visa in order to do so.
At the time that you apply for entry to the United States you will be require to demonstrate that your purpose of travel is appropriate for visa-free travel or the visa you hold, and that you intend to comply fully with your conditions of entry and that you have sufficiently strong social and economic ties to your country of residence to compel you to depart the United States at the conclusion of a temporary visit.
Immigration officials at the port of entry make the final determination of each individual’s eligibility to enter the United States.

I am still looking for written confirmation about the answer to give to question D) above. It looks as if the answer is simply that the question is worded terribly and that in fact the correct answer is to say 'No' - but this is not directly confirmed yet.
FINAL UPDATE: I successfully traveled using the ESTA (marking no for the aforementioned question) and had no problems at the border when explaining that I was visiting for a job interview. On my landing card I marked that my trip was for business purposes. I didn't even have to show any documentation other than my passport (I had printed my ESTA confirmation, hotel information, interview confirmation etc.) but obviously this may vary. Hopefully this question helps anyone in a similar situation.

How likely is it for Israeli airport security to withhold my laptop and send it on later?,"I’ll be visiting Jordan and Israel soon in a guided (recreational) group tour. The group will be some 20 people in size. The organiser gave us beautiful leaflets on what to expect in the countries we are visiting. I stumbled across the following sentence (translated from the German original) in the Israel leaflet and startled:

Sometimes laptops are withheld for inspection upon departure and later sent on.

I will admit that I am being slightly paranoid, but I am generally very unhappy to leave my laptop in someone else’s control if it was their idea (and not mine). Even if it is security forces. I realised in this question, that it would be a generally very bad idea to decline airport security or emigration officers their desire to search my laptop. Instead, I am seriously debating leaving my trusted laptop at home for the trip with all the drawbacks implied. But sometimes it doesn’t hurt to get a reality check.
How likely is it for one’s laptop to be withheld due to security reasons, meaning I’ll have to board my plane without it?
The reason I am asking here is the travel organiser’s word choice of gelegentlich in German. From patient information leaflets of medicine, that word is used to describe side-effects that happen to 0.1–1 % of all subjects. That already sounds like a threshold I’m uncomfortable with.
Answers should ideally supply a percentage of withheld laptops based on total laptop (or traveller) count. But ‘I’ve never seen that happen and I fly from Tel Aviv three times a week’, is also good enough.
Note that I am explicitly taking about the laptop being withheld while I board my plane back. Try not to include those counts where either I just log onto my account to prove it’s my laptop, or they take it for inspection into a neighbouring room but I can get it back before I board the plane.
In case it matters: I am a German citizen and to the best of my knowledge the entire group is entirely made up of German citizens.

Is domestic travel in China possible without a passport during the process of renewing a work permit?,"I need to renew my Chinese work permit in China (Tianjin) soon.

I might encounter a problem where I need to travel (return Tianjin to Shanghai) during this period (when I have the slip, not the passport).  I'm happy to take either a plane or train.
Question: Is domestic travel in China possible without a passport during the process of renewing a work permit?

Which passport to show airline when using different passports in each country?,"I am flying from the US to the UK and back next month. I use my New Zealand passport in the US (it has my visa in it).

But which passport do I show to the airline?
I want my departure from the US to be correctly recorded, so I assume I need to give the airline my New Zealand passport for departure. Will that cause problems on arrival in the UK?
I also assume I need to show my New Zealand passport to the airline when returning to the US, as they need to verify that I have a US visa. Does that cause any problems with the UK? The UK also collects exit information via airlines I believe.
(There are many questions on this site that are related, but none seem to explictly address the question of what to show to the airline when traveling to or from the US and UK. The particular issue is what data the airlines share with the countries on each end of the trip and how that may affect me.)

My husband applied from different consulate because he is presently with a UN peacekeeping mission, he has an official passport, and it was easier for to apply in Sudan.

I know that I have to enter and exit the US on the US passport and the EU on the German one. But where exactly do I ""exit"" the United States?  There is no passport control for departures in the United States. And based on what I've read, airlines send your check-in information to your destination.

Dealing with the 'unclean hand' when travelling (if you're left-handed),"
""Among Muslims, the left hand is reserved for bodily hygiene and
  considered unclean. Thus, the right hand should be used for eating.
  Shaking hands or handing over an item with one's left hand is
  considered an insult.""

A common enough sentence in many guide books and on Wikipedia.  However, being left-handed it's quite often very unnatural - you reach for food with your dominant hand, pass something with that hand, and ironically the right hand is often the one used for bodily hygiene among left-handers.
Indeed, in Uzbekistan I picked up an apple with my left hand to the horror of the locals I was with on a train ride, at which point one of them who didn't speak English graphically demonstrated that right hand is for eating and left hand is for ... elsewhere.
So, if you're left-handed, how do you deal with it? Tie a string around your hand? Just lots of practice? Or do you just not care, even if their insistence on the right hand can result in them unknowingly getting a hand that is the very one they were trying to avoid?

"In Malaysia, how should I deal with taxi drivers wanting to go off-meter?","I've been to Malaysia three times: once to Penang and twice to Kuala Lumpur. I mostly used taxis to get around, and I found that drivers always wanted to negotiate a fare up-front (which was much higher than a meter fare). Sometimes I could argue them into using the meter, but a few times (such as heading back from the KL zoo), they simply wouldn't take me unless I agreed to a flat rate.
At first, I thought they were scamming me for being a tourist. What I've heard, though, is that the law sets meter rates that are too low for the drivers to make a living, so going by the meter is simply not worth their time. I have no way of verifying that, though, and my gut reaction when someone tries to do this is that they're running a scam (this is the case in Thailand, where I was living at the time).
I'm thinking of Penang again next year. Does anyone have experience with this situation, and can you verify the cause? How trustworthy are drivers in KL and Penang in negotiating an honest fare, provided I don't let myself seem like an easy mark?

It has been a year or so since I last took the train from Sants, but I can't remember seeing any signs for luggage storage. I also recall it's a fairly large station.
Does anyone know exactly where in the station the luggage storage is, and/or if it is well sign-posted from inside the station?

Is there a village in the mountains of central Asia that isn't very hot in August from where daytrips can be made without long drives?,"My wife, myself and our baby want to go somewhere in the mountains of central Asia (Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan or similar) in August.

The idea is to be somewhere that's not too hot and that doesn't require long drives since I don't think the baby will take too kindly to it.

What are your rights if you are forced to reschedule your flight?,"If I understand correctly, if an airline cancels a flight due to reasons beyond their control (a strike for example), passengers do not receive compensation under EU rules.    
What are your rights if you have to reschedule your flight, due to reasons beyond your control (a strike for example, see below)? Can you, for example, reschedule free of charge?
Elaborated info:
The Greek seaman are currently on strike. This means there is no (public) transport from many of the smaller islands to the mainland. Due to this strike, some people I know were forced to reschedule their flight, as they couldn't get to the airport. Hopefully, the strike won't be extented another time, otherwise they would have to reschedule the flight again.

Seat selection when using online booking sites,"I am looking to book a flight soon, and in some cases I am seeing lower fares through online booking sites (Priceline, JustFly, etc) than from the airline itself.  (Note that these are not opaque fares - they are for a specific flight on a specific airline.)
It's rather important to me to be able to select a seat at the time of booking.  This would normally be possible if I were to book directly through the airline (potentially with a fee, which I am willing to pay).  If there aren't any available seats that I like, I may even want to look for a different flight.  
If I book through one of these third-party sites, in general, would I be able to choose a seat at booking or immediately thereafter?  Or will I probably just get one assigned to me, without the ability to change it?
It might be possible to use my confirmation / ticket number on the airline's site to select a seat shortly after booking, but I am not sure whether this always works.  I understand this could depend on the specific site and airline, but is there any general practice?

"A flight website offered me change/cancellation for a fee, now refuses and blames airline","I recently used a website (mytrip.com) to book a round-trip flight (with 1 stop in each direction). The website I used for booking is not the airline's own website. Now, I was not sure I would actually want the exact date I was booking, but I noticed I was being offered a 'premium package' for an extra fee, in which I could edit the flight details or cancel at no charge.
And, indeed, I ended up having to do that several days later; I needed to postpone my return by 2 or 3 days (the return flight is in two weeks from now). When I asked to do so, the website/company-behind-the-website told me it would not be possible, since the airlines does not permit changes or cancellations. I told them that they sold me that option, and they claimed I should have read the fine print. Actually that fine print was sent to me in Dutch, but even disregarding that fact, they can't sell you an ""option to do X"" and have the fine print say ""you can't do X""... I would think.
So, my question is - is there anything I can do about it? I'm not averse to paying extra (obviously, not the price of a new ticket) to make a change, but nobody seems to be willing to allow me to make it.
Notes:

I called the airline directly; they said that because my ticket is in a cheap fare category, they will absolutely under no circumstances allow any changes, even if it the flight I want was coming up and they had empty seats they weren't going to fill.
If legal jurisdiction is an issue somehow, I live in the Netherlands and the flight I want to change is from TLV to AMS.
If you need more information in order to be able to give an answer, ask.

India airports post-immigration xray check purpose?,"I've noticed that when arriving into India by air, after immigration, and after the passport stamp check to ensure you really did go through immigration, there is some sort of check where all your cabin baggage is xray'd. This is before you get to baggage claim, and before customs.
Cabin bags are xray'd here, and people walk through a metal detector, but jackets don't have to be taken off, nothing has to be taken out of bags before the xray, no-one seems to pay any attention to if the metal detector goes off or not, and bags which have triggered secondary checks elsewhere due to the amount of computers+cables in them sail through.
This makes me wonder - what is the point of this post-immigration pre-customs xray check of bags, and what are they supposed to be checking for?

Renting a flat in Lille for a few months - options beyond Air BnB?,"I'm currently giving serious considering to spending a couple of months living in Lille in northern France, mostly to try to improve my French.

Cheap places to store bags in London for a few hours?,"Almost all of the main railway stations in London have left luggage facilities. However, unlike in some European countries, this is a privately run place that stores your bags, rather than lockers. The costs at all of the main stations are £12.50 for the first 24 hours, £7.50 per day after, and they round up (so the minimum charge is £12.50 for a bag). For most of a day, that doesn't seem too bad, but it feels a bit steep to me if I just need to stash a small suitcase for 1-2 hours...
Most of the main museums and galleries in London offer storage for coats and small bags (tends to be free at the paid for museums/galleries, a recommended donation of £1-£2 at the free ones). As an example, the National Gallery only allows bags up to 43 x 66 cm (17 x 26 inches). The British Museum only allows bags up to 40x40x50cm. In both cases, larger bags aren't allowed in the building. (Very small bags are normally fine, bigger ones up to the size limit generally have to be left in the cloackroom). Those sizes are a little smaller than most cabin baggage sizes.
If you have a small-ish bag with you, that's too big for museums, and you want to pop into a museum or gallery for an hour or two, is there any option other than going first to the nearest station and paying £12.50?

UK Visitor Visa refused,"

Hi, I need some urgent help for advice on UK visitor visa.
I am an Indian citizen living in Singapore for 21 years and married to a Singapore Citizen. It is our lifelong dream to tour Europe. Once we decided 2017 was the year to travel We wanted our first destination to be London and then travel to Belgium, France and finally Italy. So we proceeded to book flight tickets, accommodations and European train tickets to process my UK visa and Schengen applications. 
I applied for UK visa on 17 April 2017 and I received the outcome of the application on 03 May 2017. Unfortunately, my tourist visa to enter UK has been rejected. 
I do not understand the reason for rejection. Here is what was stated in the refusal letter:
The Decision
When assessing your application, I must take into account your personal and economic circumstances in China when coming to my decision. It is your responsibility to demonstrate that your personal circumstances in China are such that if granted leave to enter, you will comply with all of the conditions attached to any such leave and that you will leave the UK on completion of the proposed visit. You state in your application that you are unemployed. I therefore consider that you have failed to show how you financially support yourself.
In light of the above I am not satisfied your personal and financial circumstances are as claimed and that funds you state available to you are genuinely so. I am not satisfied that you are a genuine visitor and will leave UK at the end of your visit; and that you have sufficient funds available to cover your costs whilst in the UK without working or accessing public funds. Your application for a visit visa has been refused under paragraph V4.2 (a), (c) and (e).  
I do not understand the reason for refusal. 

I do not live in China! I have travelled to China only once that too as a tourist for 3 days in 2007. The visa and immigration chops are in the passport I submitted. 
I have been living in Singapore for the past 21 years and hold a valid permanent residency. My current re-entry permit is valid till 2021. I have submitted copies of my Singapore identification card, also a copy of valid re-entry permit. I sincerely do not understand why the officer would think I live in China!
The officer has also stated that under V4.2 (a), (c) and (e) my entry has been refused. 

a.  V4.2 (a) states “will leave the UK at the end of their visit; and”
-   I have booked and paid for train travel from London to Belgium (Brussels) on 26th June and the booking proof was submitted 
-   Not only that I have also paid for train travel from Brussels to Paris, Paris to Venice, Venice to Florence, Florence to Rome and finally Rome to Chennai (India) 
-   It baffles me that even after submitting all the necessary paid travel bookings the officer would think that I will not leave the UK. What else do I have to submit to prove that I will leave the UK after my intended stay of 5 days?
b.  V4.2 (c) “is genuinely seeking entry for a purpose that is permitted by the visitor routes (these are listed in Appendices 3, 4 and 5); and”
-   My only intention to visit London is to see sights and I did state all the places I intended to visit. 
-   I also provided Airbnb booking of accommodation in London which is also fully paid for! 
-   What else is needed for me to submit to prove that I will be visiting the tourist places? 
c.  V4.2 (e) “must have sufficient funds to cover all reasonable costs in relation to their visit without working or accessing public funds. This includes the cost of the return or onward journey, any costs relating to dependents, and the cost of planned activities such as private medical treatment.”
-   I believe the bank statement I submitted had more than enough funds to support my travel. To be precise it had 18,000 Singapore Dollars which is equivalent to 10,000 pounds. 
-   My bank statement had a lot of transactions because my husband and I share the account even though it is under my name. He deposits 2500 Singapore dollars every month to my account and we jointly use the money. Plus the rental we receive every month from our property will also be deposited to my account. Which is why though I am unemployed (house wife) the savings in my account keeps increasing. I do not know how to prove this. 
-   Also, there were a lot of transfers between my account and my mother’s account, we lent her money whenever she needed money and it was agreed that she will pay back in the month of June 2017 which is the month of our travel. 
-   Apart from this we had already paid for our flight tickets, train travel throughout the trip and accommodation all paid for and submitted. 
-   I even submitted my travel insurance.
-   Again, I don’t understand what else I need to submit!
I am now running out of time because I have to apply for Schengen visa which has been scheduled on 18th May 2017. I will be leaving Singapore on 1st June and travelling to India. We are attending a wedding, a wedding reception and also a house warming of various family members then head to the Europe tour.
Now, everything is at stake because so far we have spent $5000 Singapore dollars for all bookings! It is too late cancel anything. For me to skip London and change my flight tickets it would cost me more money! I will loose $1000 which is a lot of money. Please do suggest what I should be doing. I am panicking because I need to have both my UK and Schengen Visas processed in time before I leave Singapore. It will be difficult to apply from India because we don’t live near any city that processes the visas and we will have to miss the family functions. 
I seriously think they have been unfair because I am unemployed and careless in processing my application. Again, I do not live in China! What has China got to do with the application?!
It was an online application and then I went to VFS UK to submit all the documents.

UPDATE:
I contacted UK Embassy in Singapore via Facebook right after posting the above message in stack exchange. My frustration was obvious in the message I sent which I immediately regretted. I didn't have any hope that they would respond to Facebook message so I contacted UKVI using the phone number listed in the official website, I told the officer that there seems to be a mistake as I do not live in China. The officer agreed to escalate my application refusal immediately.
He sent an email asking me to send my details such as name, passport number, GWF number etc. So I sent multiple emails (email form in the UKVI website with 500 character limitation) explaining the situation. He got back to me that my case was escalated to the relevant officer.
Then on Monday I received a FB message from Embassy of UK in Singapore saying they are investigating the case and I should be contacted in 5 days. On the same day I received an email from manila that there was a mistake and they are overturning the refusal. 
I went to VFS UK and submitted my passport. They said it will be returned with UK Visa in 3 to 5 working days. So now I am awaiting their call. 
Thanks again on providing insight right when I needed it. 

UPDATE:
VFS UK Singapore did not call me as promised. It was day 5 and the next day I had Schengen appointment booked and without a passport I won't be able to submit my documents for visa processing. So I didn't have a choice but to visit the visa application centre in person without a prior appointment. 
The security didn't let me in as expected and he asked me to wait until an officer comes out of the office for a break. :/ Lucky for me someone did come out of the office for a toilet break and I explained my situation. I was given an enquiry Queue number and the counter staff immediately gave me my passport. 
She said they called me on day 4 and that I didn't answer the phone. BUT I didn't get any phone calls! I even showed them my missed call list and there were no calls from VFS UK! They didn't have an answer. Sigh. 
Took my passport and it had the long awaited UK Visa! 
What a nightmare this experience has been!

In one on a recent documentary, vehicles stopped at an unmanned inspection station and picked up a ""white courtesy telephone"".  And nothing stops you sailing your boat across the Detroit river, indeed, a water event on the St. Clair river (near Port Huron) recently went laughably wrong and the wind took hundreds of Americans in swimsuits (no papers) to the Canadian side. 
I can certainly imagine someone whose living situation or job had you crossing several times a day, the US has places accessible only via Canada, and Canada has recreation areas only accessible to Canadians that are actually in the US.  
If someone is a proper dual citizen of both US and Canada (or any other two nation pairs), does that mean they are free to ignore border controls completely and cross wherever able? Or do they still need to visit a port of entry and do the formalities?
What would this ""visit"" consist of? Noting that the standard setup at some border crossings is to literally phone it in... can they call it in on their Iridium phone halfway across Lake Erie?

Laws requiring identification at hotel checkin,"I know that in many non-US countries they require identification to check into hotels. However, in the United States I am not aware of any laws that require this. Do they exist?
The reason I ask is that I have attempted to anonymously check into hotels in the United States and found it very difficult to do. For example, one conversation went this way (note that this is an in-person conversation, I am literally standing right in front of the guy at the desk with my bags):

Desk: I need a credit card and a driver's license.
Me: Why do you need to see a driver's license?
Desk: To verify the credit card.
Me: I plan to pay cash.
Desk: I still need a credit card.
Me: Why?
Desk: To guarantee your room.
Me: I will pay cash UP FRONT for the full amount of the stay plus a
  substantial deposit which will cover any miscellaneous charges.
Desk: I still need a credit card.
Me: Why?
Desk: I don't know, I just need it.

I have had similar conversations at several different hotels. What is going on here? Is there some secret law or something that hotels have to record your identity in the United States?
Maybe a better question would be: is it possible to check into a hotel in the United States without a driver's license and credit card?
Note I am talking about a walk-in, not making reservation. In other words just walking up to the hotel and attempting to check in, then and there, no reservation involved.

What travel document should a dual national register when booking the Helsinki-St Petersburg train?,"Someone I know is a Swedish-South African citizen, and has a Swedish ID card and a South African passport.
He's going on the Allegro train Helsinki-St Petersburg (and back), and his documents, combined, are sufficient for this trip (Swedes have freedom of movement in Finland, while South Africans are visa-free for Russia for 90 days).
The problem is: when booking the ticket online, you have to enter document info to be transmitted to the Rajavartiolaitos and the FSB, and the system only lets you put one document per direction.
So the question is: should the person put the document to be used at Finnish, or Russian, border control?
Does it differ in each direction?
I e-mailed and called VR (Finland's railway operator), but they were completely bamboozled and ignorant about the situation, and thus of no help (they said ""put in the document to be used during the journey"")

Crossing US border just to take another flight and times/rules to be considered,"I'm planning a trip to Bangkok, Thailand departing from Lima, Peru and I'm a Peruvian citizen. 
However, I am making my own itinerary since I found cheaper prices when booking flights separately.
Here's what I am planning to book:


And the following questions came up:
1. Is there a problem to cross the US border through LAX (holding a B1/B2 visa and 2 times, one on my way to BKK and another when going back to LIM) just to take another flight? I mean, I know immigration normally seals your passport with the maximum time that you are allowed to stay but, since I will enter the country and then leave it in some hours, I don't know if this will be a problem or not, when re-entering the country, or if I'm ignoring something (like a rule) that maybe I should know.
2. If there's no problem with the first question then I would like to know if the times between each flight that I am planning to book are enough. So, I know the times to go through immigration/customs/taking your bags vary from airport to airport but maybe someone knows better about LAX. Apart from that, on each flight I am considering the 3h needed before each international departure and some time for immigration/customs/taking my bags and a possible delay. However, I am specially doubting if the time before taking the flight from LAX to LIM is enough.
Any help would be appreaciated.
Thanks!

Can I carry contact solution onto a plane that is more than the 3oz limit?,"According to http://apps.tsa.dhs.gov it says the following:

You may carry liquids, gels and aerosols in your carry-on bags only if
  they adhere to the 3-1-1 rule: containers must be 3.4 ounces or less;
  stored in a 1 quart/liter zip-top bag; 1 zip-top bag per person,
  placed in the screening bin. Larger amounts of non-medicinal liquids,
  gels, and aerosols must be placed in checked baggage. 
Medically
  required liquids, such as baby formula and food, breast milk and
  medications are allowed in excess of 3.4 ounces in reasonable
  quantities for the flight. It is not necessary to place medically
  required liquids in a zip-top bag. However, you must tell the
  Transportation Security Officer that you have medically necessary
  liquids at the beginning of the screening checkpoint process.
  Medically required liquids will be subjected to additional screening
  that could include being asked to open the container. We recommend,
  but do not require, that medication be labeled to facilitate the
  security process. Many airports have designated lanes for families and
  individuals with items requiring additional assistance with screening.

The problem is, I've been able to do this once (domestic), however the second time I had it taken away (international). 
The time that I had it taken away was when I actually told the dude I had it in my bag, they removed it, kept it, and told me it was not allowed. 
Is this up to the discretion of the TSA officer, or is it due to the fact I was in the international terminal versus the domestic terminal? I don't really see the difference.

Cancelation fee on a unsuccessfully booked room,"In April we booked a Hotel for our vacation in Greece in June. The booking took place on the hotel's website. We decided to pay immediately and not have the classical ""make a reservation that you can cancel until a week ahead""-type of booking. That way we could save a few bucks. 
After having submitted the form, the Hotel approached us via mail,the payment did not work out. They asked us to send them our credit card information in plain text. I was somewhat reluctant, since this is not a secure way of transferring sensitive data. So I asked them whether they could cancel the booking and we just try it once more with another credit card via the website. They refused. So we sent them the credit card data via mail. They still could not book (we did not receive any notification from our bank about some sort of denied request). So we sent them my girlfriend's credit card information. No response, upon  request they claim the booking was once more unsuccessful. 
Next they ask us to transfer money via bank deposit. We refuse since we lose some control over the process, apart from hefty fees for international bank transfers. And somewhat everything looks very fishy and untrustworthy to me. 
That's why we asked them now to cancel the booking altogether. They want to charge us a cancelation fee. I find this an absolute disgrace.

UK Passport: Emergency appointment (supporting documents),"I asked What is the fastest way to get a UK passport? yesterday. (27/04/17) and the results of that was:
I have booked an appointment for a 1 week emergency passport. I'm currently filling out the application form to take to the interview with me (29/04/17) and I really don't want to get this wrong (as I'll be traveling to London from Nottingham).

Documentation (thus far)

I have two identical photos which abide by the guidelines set out by 'Her Majesty's Passport Office' with a countersigned signatory (from a professional person who has known me for at-least two years).
I have also collected a paper application form from my local post office. 
I have the appointment reference number which will help me gain access to the Passport Office. 


The Confusion

The gentleman at the post office said I won't require any supporting documents as I have had a passport previously and my details haven't changed.
The guidelines set out in Guidance For Attending Urgent Appointments says the opposite: 


• All supporting documents - Current Passport, Birth/Marriage/Civil Partnership Certificates or Deed Poll Confirmation etc. 


Question
Will I be required to take any supporting documents with me to the interview, if so, what will I be required to take? 
The booklet doesn't really specify much on supporting documents except the aforementioned block quote. 

Notes: 

I have had both a child passport and an adult passport previously.
I have the child passport details i.e. passport number etc.. (which is clipped/expired) but not the physical passport (in a different city in the UK).
The previous UK adult passport was lost. 

Update:
I didn't need the appointment reference number to access the building, just my surname and date of birth. Also, I advise you to go into the building atleast 15 minutes before your appointment as you queue up to go through a security checkpoint at the entrance.

What happens when you are asked to place item in the hold (checked-in) luggage?,"I have an international flight out of a USA airport recently and I've never been through one before (on the way out that is) so this is a question whose answer is not immediately obvious to me.
I 've never been asked to place any items found in my carry-on luggage with the hold luggage, but I am wondering how would that work in practice? In all international airports I've traveled from, you typically hand over you hold luggage during check-in so by the time you reach the baggage screening area you don't have it with you.
So, if you are asked to place something with the hold luggage, what exactly happens? Do you go back to the check-in counter, wait in the queue a second time, and then ask them to please bring out your luggage as you have something more you need to add to it? Or is your entire carry-on baggage placed into the hold? What if you only travel with hold luggage and a backpack or some other bag (e.g. notebook bag) that cannot be placed with the hold luggage?
The item(s) in question are mechanical keyboards so I'll be set back a few hundreds of USD if the only option at that point is to discard them. I've asked a  related question and at least of the answers I received indicates that there is a (slim) possibility I may be asked to check them in, hence this question.

flying out of US with four (4) mechanical keyboards,"I am flying out of the US (to a European destination) and I need to take four (4) mechanical keyboards (computer keyboards) to a destination with me.
Each of the mechanical keyboards has the size of a typical desktop keyboard but being mechanical they weigh a bit more than two pounds (a kilogram) each.
I intend to place them in my backpack which I will take into the cabin as my carry-on luggage. The reason is they are somewhat pricey (and brand new) and I would like to avoid having them being thrown around with the rest of the hold luggage.
Do you foresee me having any problems during baggage screening at the US airport ?
My only concern is that the TSA agents might find it odd that someone is travelling with so many keyboards, given also that they are rather unusual, i.e. heavy  (compared to the vanilla keyboards the TSA might be more accustomed to seeing). Due to the mechanical switches they employ I also have no idea whether they appear ""scary"" under X-rays. I am worried that in the worst case scenario they might ask me to discard them (under some unknown rule, e.g. weird type of electronic equipment).
Should I be worried and is there anything I can do to make this as uneventful as possible ?

Why do trains in the UK start running so late on Sunday morning?,"On a Sunday, the first train from Lancaster to Manchester departs at 11:24 (this is the Furness line).  On Saturdays this is at 6:24.  To Birmingham, the first train on Saturdays is 6:58, on Sundays 11:58.  To Glasgow, Saturdays 6:64, Sundays 11:54.  The pattern is true elsewhere as well: from Blackpool, first Saturday train departs 5:18, first Sunday train 11:21.  Boston, Saturdays 6:13, Sundays 12:13.  Lincoln, Saturdays 5:26, Sundays 11:05.  It's not true everywhere, but it is in many places.  For the rest of the day, the Sunday frequency is not much less than the Saturday frequency.
I've taken the first Sunday train from Lancaster to Manchester twice.  Both times, the train was extremely busy.  On neither occasion could I find a place to sit.  On one occasion, people were left behind on the platform as they could not board the overfull train.  Although a sample size of two is small, I will assume this train is always busy.
Considering that demand clearly outstrips supply on Sunday morning, why do trains start running so late?

Old passport has missing pages. What should I tell the Visa Officer during the visa interview?,"I am applying for US F1 visa. My old passport had some mistake in my surname. So I got a new passport two years back. I did not know that I may need my old passport during the visa interview. My sister took my old passport saying that she will play with it. When I asked the passport back I discovered she has torn down two of its pages, including the first page where they put the CANCELLED stamp. All the personal information pages are intact. Do visa officers scrutinize the old passports ? Now what should I tell the visa officer if they ask me about the missing pages ?

Do debit cards satisfy liquidity requirement at UK immigration entry,"I know about the requirements concerning proof of funds for UK immigration purposes. They are well laid out in the answer to Can I convince embassies to accept my overpaid credit card as a proof of funds. My question however is not covered in the answer in the linked question.
One requirement is that the money is in liquid form and actually available to the applicant.
I will be traveling to the UK with bank statements and everything showing the provenance of the funds in my account etc. However I will not be carrying physical cash more than £20, I hate carrying cash and for even the smallest transactions I use credit cards, partly to accumulate points, the protection and the exchange rate.  
For the UK, my question is will carrying a debit card linked to my accounts be considered liquid enough and a proxy for cash? What about a credit card? Note that I am not using the cards as proof of funds, my bank statements etc cover that. I am only using them as proof of liquidity. I am concerned because the immigration officer kept asking me how much cash I had on my previous visit although I had shown him credit and debit cards. I know for the Schengen areas credit cards are acceptable.

Can I convince embassies to accept my overpaid credit card as a proof of funds?,"I managed to put a few $k USD in my PayPal account from a side business over time. Now, the only problem is PayPal does not have the option to send me the money in a cheque to cash it due to my location, as they do not have that option for countries other than the US. The only option I have is sending the money to my credit card. 
In addition to that, my credit card issuer allows me to overpay my credit card, and the excess amount will be treated as if it was on a debit account, that's cool but I can't withdraw that money in cash, because cash rules will still apply if I try to cash that amount from any ATM, meaning I will lose some good % from that money.
So basically I will have a credit card with a few extra $k ready to be spent without taking any credit from the bank. 
Will the US embassy or any EU embassy accept this as a proof of fund since it is as good as cash in my checking account (I can provide the embassy with a credit card monthly report which shows this)? I searched and found nothing related to this.

We were stopped by Border Patrol while traveling within the US without our passports. Would this cause issues for future travel?,"A couple of friends and I on F-1 Student Visas decided to visit San Diego Border Field State Park. We looked up the park and the requirements on the website say:

The US side is supervised by Border Patrol agents and visitors should
  be prepared to show ID (driver's license is sufficient).

It also says on the FAQ: 

Permanent residents, people with tourist, student, or work visas can
  go to the park without risk.

At the entrance we met Border Patrol who asked us to show ID, all of us had CA Driver's licenses which we showed to them. They asked us our nationality and we told them that (Non US). At that point they told us we needed to have all our documents (I-20, Passport, Visas) on us at all times and just the driving license would not do. Thankfully all of us had scans of all these documents on our phones. They noted our passport numbers and told us to wait while one of them went to his car to check them out. He came back a few minutes later and told us that we would need to go the border patrol station to have our documents checked. He said it was a 'deportable crime' for us not to have our documets on us at all times. 
They took us to the border patrol station in their car (after putting our belongings in a bag) and made us have our finger prints taken after which they checked out document numbers and status. After this (about 40 minutes) they dropped us back at the park without any charges or anything and told us to have our documents with us at all times. We were treated courteously and the engaged in friendly chatter and told us we didn't need to worry if we were in the US legally.
We asked one of the officers if this incident would show up on our immigration record and he said that it would but we don't need to worry as it would just show up that we were detained and released after all our documents checked out.

Do I need a visa to visit the UK with my EU partner?,"I am not from EU. I have Spanish partner and we live in Spain and, because of our official relationship, I have a Spanish family resident permit. We are going to travel to the UK together for tourism. I am confused whether I need an EEA family permit or not.
I will not live there and I'm going to travel with my partner. I was told that I don't need a visa, that showing our civil union document will be sufficent. Is this correct, or do I need a visa to enter the UK?

Thank you so much for your answer. Let me give you more detail.
I hold Turkish citizenship.
My resident card exactly says that Residence Card of a Family Member of a Union Citizen "" tarjeta de familiar de la union. 
my case is like For example, a non-EEA spouse of a German national living in Germany will usually hold a residence permit issued under German domestic law. Therefore, a United Kingdom EEA family permit is required for travel and entry to the UK , therefore i should consider that i need to EEA Family Permit even if for touristic trip with my partner

Are 2:05 hours enough for a Schengen to non-Schengen transfer in Schiphol?,"If everything goes according to plan, we arrive in the beginning of the July at Schiphol at 16:10 with a KL1782 from Hamburg and depart at 18:15 with a SU2695 to Moscow Sheremetyevo. Thus we have 2 hours and 5 minutes. Is it enough time?
We travel from a Schengen country (Germany) to a non-Schengen country (Russia), thus, according to KLM's website, we should expect additional security checks and customs inspections. However how long do they usually take in Schiphol? Plus, is a flight between Germany and Russia (with connection to the Netherlands) considered intercontintental (50 min transfer) or inter-european (40 min transfer)?
Actually I do think 2:05 hours should be enough, since according to recent flight statistic of these flights (around this week), these two flights often arrive too early and often depart too late. Granted, July may be a busier month, thus those statistics may not apply then, or I may be just unlucky at that day. Do you know whether these flights follow the same pattern at early July as today (mid May)?
In addition I have another question. Since KML and Aeroflot are in an alliance, IIRC I'd usually get the next flight for free, if I come too late to my flight, if the reason was not my fault. However does this also apply in Moscow Sheremetyevo, if I come too late, because the flight I was a given in Schiphol didn't match with my other flight?
PS: I booked my flight with flighttix.de. Does this change somehow the fact that I get another flight for free if I come too late to the other?

"In Taiwan, do ATMs in convenience stores (7-Eleven, FamilyMart) charge higher fees than ATMs at banks?","In Taiwan like other East Asian countries (except China) using an ATM for a foreigner is quite a pain.
One thing I personally hate is ATM fees. Australian banks all gouge us outrageously already on overseas withdrawals, which I sadly can't avoid so I am willing to go to extra effort to avoid or minimize the ATM fees I pay on the local end.
ATMs in convenience stores seem to be easier to find if you're in an unusual location and less confusing to use. They don't force you to choose between Cirrus, Plus, Visa, and a bunch of other options as the first step. They ""just work"".
But at least 7-Eleven charges a fee of $100 TWD, about $4 AUD or enough to buy two large coffees or two meals of dumplings. I already often pay about $15 AUD per withdrawal so I'm not happy to pay another $4. I'd rather spend my money on local food than billionaire corporations.
The two or three times I used bank ATMs here and actually succeeded in navigating the options and unhelpful error messages I did not notice any message about whether there was a fee or how much it was.
I know in Australia privately owned ATMs like those in petrol stations, convenience stores, and pubs that don't carry a specific bank logo all charge the highest ATM fees. Do privately owned ATMs charge more in Taiwan?
If the banks are charging me a comparable fee anyway then I'll choose the 7-11 ATMs because they're easier. If the banks don't have a fee then I'll put up with the terrible user experience to avoid donating $4 more to billionaires each time.
I've been hunting for the answer on the Internet a couple of times and just can't seem to find the answer.

"Connection times, how much incentive do airlines have to be realistic?","Consider a question such as Is My Newark Connection Time Enough, where an international arrival to Newark in one terminal has a 90 minute connection from another terminal. One response I see is on the lines

obviously the airline considers the connection time sufficient or they
  wouldn't offer it, and anyway the airline will simply rebook if you miss the connection.

My question is whether we know how carefully the airlines consider the feasibility of connection times? 
It seems to me that it might on average be possible to make a 90 minute connection at Newark, but there are a lot of specific factors that affect an individual's chances of making a connection. For example.

US Citizens clear immigration into the US more quickly than non-US citizens, do the airlines consider citizenship when offering a connection?
If arriving internationally you clear immigration which takes you land-side, the then need to clear security again. The delays at security vary markedly by time of day. Do airlines factor in such time-of-day delays?
Flights vary markedly in their on-time arrival statistics. Does the airline consider the punctuality statistics when setting a connection time.

My cynical thought is that an airline actually has little incentive to be concerned about a few folks missing connections:

You picked a nice flight with a good end-to-end schedule, you miss the connection, They already have your money, you have the stress and inconvenience.
Planes are over-booked, a few folks missing connections actually helps the airline!

As an example a quick search for a route I use quite often, LHR-> BNA, shows this connection
London (LHR) to Nashville (BNA) — Wed, Sep 13
London (LHR) to Newark (EWR) — Wed, Sep 13 United 76
Dep: 11:40 am Arr: 3:05 pm
Layover in EWR - 1h 10m
Newark (EWR) to Nashville (BNA) — Wed, Sep 13 United 239

Which airlines need to hold interline agreements with each other in order for an itinerary to be bookable?,"I was poking at ITA Matrix out of curiosity, and tried to find flights from Shungnak, AK to Hyannis, MA.  Theoretically, this would be a 6-stop flight (there are other possible itineraries as well, but assume the seasonal JFK-HYA service on jetBlue isn't a thing for this):

Shungnak to Kobuk on Ravn Connect (operated by Hagelund Aviation)

Kotzebue to Anchorage on Ravn Alaska
Anchorage to Seattle on Alaska Airlines
Seattle to Boston on jetBlue
Boston to Hyannis on Cape Air

However, ITA Matrix cannot find an itinerary for this, and I suspect it's because of interline agreement issues.  This brings us to the larger question, though: which airlines in an itinerary need to have interline agreements with each other to make an itinerary bookable?
Is it the case that the marketing carrier needs to have interline agreements with all the operating carriers?  Or can you book a flight in a case where all the carriers have an interline agreement with at least one other carrier, but there is no carrier that has interline agreements with all other carriers in the route?

Flight transfer via Ireland with a UK reentry ban,"I am a British citizen and my fiance is American. Last year he got deported and a 2 year ban from entering the UK.
This is because we stayed in Dublin for 3 months, then the UK for just over 3 months. We thought that we were doing nothing wrong as the maximum amount of time you can stay in the UK as a visitor is 6 months. But because Dublin and UK are a common travel area they told us that the 3 months in Dublin counted towards the UK stay.
I want to meet up with him in Amsterdam, however, many of the flights have a transfer in Dublin. I was wondering if the UK ban would apply to Dublin, seeing as we stayed there initially which is what triggered the UK ban.
Would they turn him away when he arrives there? Are there exceptions if its a flight transfer/layover?

UK Tourist Visa Refusal - Advice for Supporting Documents,"Just looking for a bit of advice here. 
My girlfriend recently applied and was refused for a tourist (6 month) visitor visa for the UK. She is of Uzbek nationality but is currently living and studying in Lithuania on a temporary residence permit.
She is going to reapply as soon as possible as we were planning to spend summer here together before she was to return for her studies. I am a British citizen by the way.
I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions of supporting documents that should be added this time round when applying that would help strengthen her case. 
It seems to me that they do not believe we are together, so would including previous travel tickets, photographs together and a flat contract demonstrating that we have actually lived together help (we lived together in Cyprus for 3 months)?
Last time I included a written and signed letter of declaration stating that she would be staying with me, a copy of a bank statement as proof of address and a photocopy of my drivers licence. Included was also a letter indicating she would be returning for her next study year from her university.
Any help on the situation would be greatly appreciated so that we can rebook the flights as soon as possible. 
I've attached the letter she was sent back below as well.
Thanks!

Price limits for self-arranged hotel after flight cancellation,"This question from another traveller states their flight within the EU was cancelled, they had to stay the night and the airline told them to get their own accomodation. They did so and eventually successfully reclaimed 300 Euros for the night.
This made me wonder: is there any practical limit to what you can claim? If there is a trade fair in town, prices for standard 4-star business hotels can easily reach 500 Euros and more. And what would stop you from getting the presidential suite at the Adlon Berlin? 
EU regulation 261/2004 states ""passengers shall be offered free of charge [...] hotel accommodation in cases [...] where a stay of one or more nights becomes necessary"".  This does not make any statements about reasonable prices, but it does seem to assume that airline organizes the accomodation.
So... what kind of expensives could be expected to be reimbursed, if necessary with the help of a court? And I assume one should try to have the airline employees give something in writing?

Is it Reasonable to book Ferries from Santorini to Mykonos in Advance?,"We are looking to travel from Santorini to Mykonos by boat in the second half of June in a group of 5 - 10 people.
Due to the relative clarity of information available online, the boats offered by Hellenic Seaways currently seem like our favourite option, and they offer an online booking facility via the agency Paleologos S.A..
At least in September/October, it sounds like those ferries aren't too crowded. Likewise, Santorini's port website implies that ferries are most likely crowded only in July and August, while of course, things might be different in June. (Also, none of the resources I found specifically dealth with the probability of finding enough tickets for a larger group of people.)
Is it a good idea to book those tickets for June beforehand online, or does the gain of having the security that the boat is not booked out not match up with the possible hassle of actually finding the pre-booked tickets on Santorini and relying on the online booking?

to stop following a clear signal being given by the intending passenger), and I know a lot of regular rural buses do a similar thing too.

Canceled + rebooked flight 10 days in advance from Europe to US - does EU compensation apply?,"The EU regulations on Air passenger rights describe when you are entitled to compensation for delay:

If your flight is delayed at departure, you have the right to assistance, to reimbursement and a return flight, depending on the duration of the delay and the distance of the flight.
  If you arrived at your final destination with a delay of more than 3 hours, you are entitled to compensation, unless the delay was due to extraordinary circumstances.

or for downgrade:

If you are downgraded, you are entitled to reimbursement of a percentage of the price of your ticket, depending on the flight distance as follows: ...

Yesterday 8 May I happened to notice on the KLM website that my non-stop international flight AMS-SFO (operated by KLM/Delta) of 18 May is canceled. I did not receive notice (it is 9 May now, so maybe it is pending). I received an email late on 9 May. They booked me for an flight with a stop-over in Detroit that leaves 45 minutes later, but I will arrive 6:15 hours later in SFO.
Does this count as either a delay or a downgrade that I can claim compensation for?
I have gone through both EU Regulation on air passenger rights and European Commission Interpretative Guidelines on air passenger rights but the texts regarding cancellation are not obvious IMO.
Under Scope paragraph 2 it says that the rules 

... shall apply on the condition that passengers:
  (a) [skip]; or
  (b) have been transferred by an air carrier or tour operator from the flight for which they held a reservation to another flight, irrespective of the reason.

Under Cancellation it says

In case of cancellation of a flight, the passengers concerned shall:
  (a) [skip]
  (b) [skip]
  (c) have the right to compensation by the operating air carrier in accordance with Article 7, unless:
  (i) [skip]; or
  (ii) they are informed of the cancellation between two weeks and seven days before the scheduled time of departure and are offered re-routing, allowing them to depart no more than two hours before the scheduled time of departure and to reach their final destination less than four hours after the scheduled time of arrival;

(ii) applies to me
I can quote more text parts from these two documents, but I think that goes to far here.
Notes:

Did I obtain re-routing under satisfactory conditions? (BTW they also use the term comparable transport conditions)
I did not get a reason for the cancellation.
Of course, I can only apply for compensation after my actual flight.

This email (and email address) feels very weird to me. I quickly found this post stating that there are fraud websites. Scrolling through my history, I realized that I used the website http://www.esta.us/ and not https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/. I seem to be the victim of a fraud.
I do not quite remember if I paid and what I paid when applying for this ESTA but I guess I paid something. I failed to see any payment on my personal bank account (via my bank website) though.
Am I the victim of a fraud (or legal but unreasonably expensive service)? What would you advise me to go from here?

i had provided my partner's as well as my bank statement, my partner had transferred money into my account for the trip, but i had written that my partner will be supporting the trip; hence they refused saying that your partner doesn't have enough money in the bank to support me. but the money has already been transferred into my bank.. how can i correct this mistake next time? i am a student and my partner is also a masters student .he gets monthly stipend from college while i dont get, how can i apply next time?

Dependent visa for Masters students in Germany,"I am an Indian citizen. My husband is admitted as a Masters student at TUM and I intend to join him there.

How do customs and immigration work in a sailboat?,"So, I have this crazy dream.  I'd love to purchase a little sailboat, make my way down the East Coast, across the Carribean, down South America, and end up in the Falklands, maybe Tierra Del Fuego, and Antarctica if I really could develop some seamanship skills. As I think about the logistics, I realize, it's a bit of an undertaking, but from a skill level, it seems ""do-able.""  
What has just occurred to me from a planning perspective, however, is that I have just totally  schluffed off the important legal niceties, of oh, entering a foreign country!  But then I realize, a coastline is way bigger than the secured portion of an airport.
So, here's the question.  Let's say I've shoved across from Florida and sailed down to Brazil.  Yes, that's a long trip, but I'm going to guess the islands are a bit more sophisticated when its comes to ports. When I show up in Brazil, what's to stop me from pulling into a harbor, getting out of the boat, walking into the town, and buying supplies?
At what point do I need to show my passport, do a customs declaration or in any fashion present myself to authorities as a gringo who needs to be admitted to the country?
In other words, how do I legally enter a country when I'm in a private sailboat?

Should I protest this as an error, or just tolerate the extra two days cut out of my ninety?
To make matters worse, on this visit, entering BIO, the guy saw the BCN entry but not the LIS exit on the same page and gave me a hard time about it.

Can Russians exit Russia on an internal passport?,"Someone I know is a dual citizen of Sweden and Russia, holding a Swedish ID card and Russian internal passport, but neither a Swedish passport nor Russian external passport.
She's planning to travel overland Sweden - Finland - Russia - Georgia - Armenia.
Georgia accepts Swedish IDs while Armenia accepts Russian internal passports. And obviously entering Russia on an internal passport shouldn't be a problem, as it proves she's Russian.
The problem is: I've heard that Russia doesn't let you exit on an internal passport other than to countries accepting them for entry, which the next country, Georgia, doesn't.
Is this true? What if she explains that she's a dual national and using another document for Georgia?
UPDATE: OK, so I spoke to the concerned person as you had some questions. Her father registered her birth with the embassy in Stockholm and got her an international passport (she's had two, one between 2004-2009 and one between 2009-2014), with which her family visited Russia on several occasions, most recently in 2012.
In 2013-2014, she spent an exchange year in St Petersburg, during which she got the internal passport, which is valid until 2019. Shortly after returning to Sweden, her international passport expired and she hasn't got a new one since.
UPDATE 2: She is a stubborn b***h xD But I finally convinced her to get an (old template) Russian external passport. So apparently she'll use all three documents during the trip: Swedish ID at Schengen and Georgian borders; international Russian passport at the Russian border, and Russian internal passport at the Armenian border.

If I'm flying an itinerary into the US where I need to transit via one of the airports which are under the purview of the recent ban, then does it apply to me?
As an example, if I were flying from New Delhi to New York with say Emirates in a flight which would have a halt at Dubai. It's most certainly legal to carry a laptop or tablet in the cabin from Delhi to Dubai and if there aren't any additional security checks in Dubai then I guess it would be very hard to enforce the ban in such a case.
The reason that I ask is because the fine text of the ban doesn't seem to be available and some of the media outlets seem to be saying that this impacts only direct flights.

Canada immigration requirements for Alaska Cruise ship,"I plan to take the Alaska cruise ship sometime this summer from Seattle which ports at Victoria BC Canada for few hours (~ 6 to 11 hours). The cruise will return to Seattle port too.
Typically I would require a Canadian visa to board the cruise ship. It gets a bit tricky. I have a Canada PR card (Mar 2013, expiring Mar 2018) but I have never been to Canada since I got our PR (I am working in US on work visa). It seems my Canada PR is not valid (I'm not sure of this yet) as I do not meet the minimum stay requirement to maintain Canada PR card (730 days in 5 years in Canada). 
Questions:

Will I have immigration issues boarding the cruise ship from Seattle using my Canada PR card?
If I clear immigration at Seattle using my Canada PR card, can I choose to not get off at port of Victoria and simply stay on ship?
Or should I apply for Canadian TRV? Do I need to first renounce my Canada PR card?

Followup questions:

Is there any way that when I board the cruise ship that the immigration officer is able to determine that I do not satisfy the RO and so my PR is not valid thereby not letting me board the ship? I ask as if this may happen then I will lose all the cruise money.

Other followup questions:
I ask these as I stay close to the border and I may vacation for few days at a later date.

Is there a way to know if my PR is invalid as of now (some website, etc)?
If the adjudicator determines that I'm no longer a PR at border/PoE (port of entry), would I immediately know that I'm reported? Do I lose my PR status immediately or after certain days (if so, how many)?
Is it a bad remark on my profile if I'm reported? Basically, is it better that I myself renounce at the border? Would it affect my chances of my TRV at a later date?

Airline asking for power of attourney before paying compensation,"My partner and I (both based in the UK) were delayed on a recent flight to Spain with Iberia airline.  After a lot of back and forth communication between my partner and Iberia, they have agreed to pay us compensation.

In order for us to proceed with the payment, please send us the following bank details to e-mail cacgestionjuridica@iberia.es  :

Power of Attorney signed by all the passengers involved.

I'm obviously not very happy giving actual legal power of attourney to an airline, nor does this request make any sense to me.

Suggestion for routes from California to Italy?,"I noticed there are no direct flights from USA west coast to Italy. All have connections, but all the routes still end up on Italy's international airports. But mostly because I am searching for flights ending on those airports.
I know flights between Schengen countries often go to smaller airports too. But you have to know the final airport because ticket purchasing sites won't let you search for country. (I'd love to be told otherwise on this btw!)
Since the international ones are far away from my destination anyway, i'd like to try and search for routes ending on the smaller airports to see if I can find better prices and/or better proximity to my actual destination in Calabria.

My mother back in India running a small business which existed from our forefathers and she took over since 2008 after the death of my father to keep her engaged all day.
When we processed her visa, showing bank accounts , shop document/licences , sponsor letters etc. Despite of this her visa got rejected objecting to proofs related to business. Although, She showed enough proofs like rent receipts, shop licence, bank statements etc.. Although visa officer is claiming that she didn't submitted any of the proofs.
The business is too small that there is no need to maintain any ledger, employees and most of the cases the customer purchase with cash.
Just for your information, I asked my mother to reapply with additional justification but it got rejected.
Please advice what can be done to prove that she is Genuine visitor.

Visa with criminal record,"I am Ravi, I am from India and I have recently travelled to Germany. I had a visa type C that allowed to stay there for 9 days. I have entered Germany on 6th March 2017 and I was supposed to leave Germany on 14th March 2017. But, I had to leave on 16th March 2017. Unfortunately, while coming back to India, my flight from Berlin to Frankfurt had been cancelled due to an airport strike at Berlin. The airline was Lufthansa. My flight from Berlin to Frankfurt was supposed to leave Berlin at 7:45 AM and reach Frankfurt at 8:55 AM. My connecting flight to Chennai leaves Frankfurt at 10:15 AM. I reached Berlin airport at 6:30 AM only to find out that my flight had gotten cancelled. They had not even informed me about the strike until I went to their counter in Berlin airport. Had I been informed of the strike earlier, I would have directly gone to Frankfurt to catch my flight to Chennai. They said there wasn't any flight available for 2 days (i.e free) out of Germany to India and they can't accommodate me in Frankfurt. So, I had asked them to book for the next available flight which was only after 2 days. After 2 days, on reaching Frankfurt airport from Berlin, I was stopped at Immigration counter saying that I have overstayed in Germany than what my visa permits. I was then escorted to the police station where the police charged me with
breaching criminal offence legal code 95 Abs. 1 Nr. 2 AufenthG. I boarded the next flight back to India and came back. Here, I would like to know 4 things:

Will my passport be blacklisted or something forever?
Will this criminal record show up every time my passport is checked/swiped by any country's immigration department.
How should I proceed while applying for visas to other countries. Ex: Hong Kong pre-arrival registration form has a question that asks a person if they had ever over-stayed/ have any criminal record in other country? So, how should I answer this?
I am planning to do my Masters abroad. So, will the universities be aware of the incident using my passport number?

Italy Trains - Buying tickets at a station with no ticket office and no ticket machine,"On a recent visit to Italy I found myself in situation regarding train tickets.
I was at Pioltello Limito station on the outskirts of Milan wanting to get to Milan Centrale. There was no ticket office open, no ticket machine to buy tickets and no obvious signage to direct a traveller to buy a ticket.
I was forced to buy a ticket very quickly from the TrenItalia website with only a couple of minutes to spare before the train arrived. I had the luxury of having a smartphone and included data bundle in Europe but not everyone is fortunate to have this.
What is the process to buying tickets when faced with this situation? Could one get on a train without a ticket and not face any repercussions? This is allowed in the UK as some smaller stations to not have ticket machines or a ticket office. You can buy a ticket from the train guard on the train.
It appears to be common in Italy. I was faced with the same situation at another station later in the trip but there was a very poorly written hand made sign pointing travellers to a nearby cafe.

Visiting Croatia while in possession of a Swiss permit 'L',"I hold a passport that requires me to have a visa to visit pretty much any country. However, as I am temporarily in Switzerland for 6 months, I have been given the Swiss 'L' permit that is valid until the end of October. 
Although I need a visa, by right, to visit Croatia, I understand that Croatia has certain waivers in which visa nationals in possession of a multiple-entry Schengen visa or a valid Schengen residence permit can be allowed entry. 
Does that mean I will be allowed to enter Croatia with my passport & my Swiss L permit if I were to visit in July? It would still be 90 days before the expiry of the Swiss permit.

Is leaving airport at a stop before the final destination illegal?,"There are tricks such as ""fuel dumping"" or ""hidden city ticketing"" which involve booking a ticket composed of several connecting flights, then leaving the airport at a stop, possibly even ""hopping off"" a plane (intermediate landing). Rationale: Sometimes these tickets are cheaper than a ticket to one of the stops. So one adds an additional leg and discards it.
Some people say that when using such tricks, one enters a legal gray area. But I wonder:
Could leaving the airport at a stop really be illegal, i.e. violating an airline's or a travel agency's terms?
Also there are suggestions that one should not request an upgrade, because then the trick may be discovered by the airline. Here I wonder:
How can they know that one will throw away the last leg?

US citizen travelled to Canada without realizing DUI was a problem but got through,"I travelled with a US citizen friend a couple of times to Canada (my home country) for a few days each time. We never had a problem at any border and, being Canadian, I don't know as much as I should about Canadian entry laws. My friend has a single DUI from a long time ago (less than 10 years at the time of our travels), and neither of us were aware that it was automatic grounds for denial of entry. I discovered the rule by accident during random web browsing, and it's now been more than 10 years since the DUI, so in the ordinary course of events, Canada would automatically forgive it if they were to try to enter now. But now I'm worried that my friend has broken the law by not disclosing what they didn't know they were supposed to disclose. Are there any penalties for this situation? What if, hypothetically, they were to try to apply for residency/citizenship at a later date, would this be grounds for automatic denial?

Unusual experience when exchanging money in Florence,"This happened to a friend of mine last Saturday in Firenze Santa Maria Novella train station.
In a rush to catch a train and low on Euros she approached the foreign exchange counter in the train station and asked for €150. The clerk processed the request and asked for her to put her UK bank card in the chip and pin reader. Instead of the reader saying €150 it said €180.xx. My friend questioned this as she thought she misheard or misunderstood the request. The clerk responded by saying this is the tax added on. She then thought she would receive €180 plus change but no, she only received €150.
In a rush to catch a train my friend just accepted the hit and got the €150 for €180 something. Can someone explain what this 'tax' is. I thought it might have been commission, but the clerk clearly said tax apparently.
I would have assumed any 'fee' was attached to the currency conversion rate, not an additional 'tax' or 'currency exchange fee' on top of the transaction

"Mobile Data for Short Trip to Toronto, Canada","I am an American planning a short trip (a long weekend) to Canada. I want to allow for using 2 Gig of data in the few days I am there (if you imagine that I am a photographer who wants to access maps and upload photos in real time you will be close to understanding my needs though I will be using a very different set of apps.) 
I will be solely in the Greater Toronto Area, and do not need to worry about rural connectivity. 
While free talk or text would be a bonus I am not willing to pay even $10 more for that. I just want data. When I want to communicate with people I have text chat apps for that.
My US carrier (AT&T) would charge an outrageous amount of money ($120 for just 750 Mb) and does not appear to be a viable option. My phone and my tablet can both be unlocked, and I could tether the tablet off the phone if I had to. 
It would be incredibly inconvenient for me to take time out of my short and overscheduled trip to visit a mobile store or kiosk, especially as I expect to rely on mobile data to navigate, pay for transit fares, etc.  Ideally I want to buy a Sim or two online, pop it into my phone and/or tablet, and have it just work as soon as my plane lands. (If I can set up at a kiosk at the airport that might be an option but I would much rather know that everything is taken care of before I arrive.) 
I see both Bell and Virgin Sims for sale on Amazon.com but neither company's Web site seems to allow me to purchase a tablet only plan.   (The 5 GB and 2 GB plans from Virgin would be very appealing if they were actually available to purchase.) 
I have since been told that if I call one of the carriers and talk to a human operator a few times I will eventually get one who knows the full range of available plans and might be able to help me.  (This seems like a rather inefficient way to do business, but I understand that I will not be a highly profitable customer for them...) 
What are my options? 
Update:  after doing what I thought was sufficient research I bought a virgin Mobile sim off Amazon.Com when I tried to activate it I learned that the tablet plans I had seen on their Web site were not available; the best the agent could offer me was $35 for 1 GB, with an overage charge of ""20 cents per Web page.""  The agent didn't understand why I didn't think that was a meaningful number.  
I am running short of time to set something up before my trip and am feeling rather desperate.

Can a person be arrested/detained if a prohibited item is found in the carry-on luggage while transiting?,"Recently, while returning from St Petersburg to New Delhi via Almaty in Kazakhstan, our family had a rather bizarre experience. Before querying anything, I would like to sum up the situation -
Event 1
Our family of three checks-in at St Petersberg Pulkovo airport. At the last moment, we decided to take one of the checked-in baggage as a carry-on. While doing it, we forgot that the bag had a knife with 1-inch blade.
Event 2
The bag passes the screening at St Petersberg airport. We land in Almaty after 5 hours. During transiting, the knife is discovered in the bag and we are stopped. Normally when this happens, the officials just throw the prohibited items but the officials at the screening checkpoint decide to call the police.
Event 3
The police arrive and asks one of us to claim the bag. My mother claims it and her passport is taken by them. We start to worry a bit at this point. They return with a form titled “Protocol Exemption”. We sit with a Kazakh/Russian speaking policeman who fills the form in Russian. When my father expressed his concerns about what the form was about and what was being written on it, the policemen keeps repeating “ I am police ” and “ Law section 38 and 40 "" with a stern look. Our requests for a translator are ignored. Finally, after being harassed and mystified for 15 minutes, we are let off after we sign the form. 
Though I understand it was our fault of not checking the stuff in the bag before taking it as a carry on. I have few questions regarding the situation :-

Why wasn’t the knife taken out at Russian airport ? Is it because the officers failed to discover it or it is due to the fact that knives only larger than particular size are banned in carry-on baggage in Russia ?
As I had experienced before this trip, prohibited items in the baggage are often thrown. Were we made to sign only because we were in transit and had completed one part of journey with the knife in carry on baggage ?
Can carrying a prohibited item result in detention or arrest ? It would be great if anyone can explain this with respect to Kazakh law.
Was the policeman interested in taking bribe by intimidating us ?

EDIT:
Attached is the piece of paper issued to us after the matter got resolved.

EDIT 2:

Will this incident result in extra scrutiny by the Kazakh officials or those from CIS countries if the passenger visits in future ? In other words, are such incidents kept in record books ?

Parents UK Visitor Visa Refused - please help!,"I have recently applied for a UK Vusitor Visa for my parents who live in India and it got rejected.

As for my parents' financial proof, I have added their bank statements with balance around £4.4k and a letter by Chartered Accountant, stating the property, fixed deposit and assets worth £33K ( which I think got completely neglected by the ECO). I have got the rejection with below points:
******************** Letter *****************

The decision
I have refused your application for a visit visa because I am not
  satisfied that you meet requirements of paragraph 4 2 of Appendix V
  Immigration Rules for Visitors because:- 
1.You have applied to travel to the UK alongside your wife for three months to visit your son i have taken into account that you have
  provided details of your sponsor's financial and living circumstances
  in the United Kingdom and l am very aware of the importance of family
  visits and the significance which should be afforded to maintaining
  family links, however, it is your circumstances as the applicant which
  is of most importance. 
2.You have stated on your application form that you and your wife are both retired. You have not stated in your application form or
  presented documentation to suggest that you are in receipt of any
  regular income. You have estimated the personal cost of this visit at
  £2,000 To demonstrate your financial circumstances you have provided
  an Indian Bank statement, account ending ******5190, which shows a
  closing balance of Rs.360,450 (£4,291). You therefore propose to spend
  over half of your savings on this visit to the UK. Given your
  financial circumstances as outlined above, and that you have not
  demonstrated any income, I am not satisfied that this proposed
  expenditure is credible. 
3.I have also considered the pattern of deposits into your bank account. I note that in the month of February 2017, this account
  received a number of deposits totalling Rs.200,190 (£2,383). I am
  unable to confirm from the documents submitted the origin of these
  funds.
4.In light of all of the above I am not satisfied as to your intentions in wishing to travel to the United Kingdom or that you will
  leave the UK at the end of your visit. Furthermore, I am not satisfied
  that you have sufficient funds available to cover your costs whilst in
  the UK without working or accessing public funds Your application for
  a visit visa has been refused under paragraph V4.2 (a) (e)

I am considering reapplying for the Visa, but I wanted to clarify below doubts? So, can you please guide me on the below points based on their experience?
Questions  : 
For point 2: 
a. As my parents are retired they dont have a regular income - how should I respond to this question?
b. For spending half of the amount - We can dissolve one of the properties worth 15 lakh and provide the proof of same - will that work?
For Point 3 : Also, I keep on sending money to them, is it fine to state that in my next application?
Thanks in Advance

I will be travelling to Singapore this summer for a conference. On the return journey, I have a layover in Narita (Tokyo, Japan) for over 24 hours. I intend to apply for a transit visa for two possible circumstances as described below:
a. Step out of the airport for a few hours before catching my flight back to the States. 
b. Potentially extend this leg of the trip by 5-7 days for a short stay in Japan as a tourist. 
This link tells me that either circumstance should be possible with a transit visa. Given the above information, what do I input on the application form for Guarantor/ Inviter?
In addition, how do I, an Indian in the USA, apply for this visa? Do I have to personally visit the local consulate for a transit visa application?

Can an Australian fly from the US to Cuba?,"Is it possible to get a direct flight from USA to Cuba if you're not a citizen of either country? I know that to fly out of the US you need to have applied for a Visa which you then pay for and pick up at the airport on your way into Cuba, but is that only for US citizens?
Would an Australian have to organise their travel visa in advance? Would they also need to 'prove to customs' that they were travelling for one of the 12 reasons mandated by OFAC?
I would in particular like to hear anecdotes from people who have travelled to Cuba from the US and were not citizens of the US or Cuba.

"Application for UK Standard visa twice refused, what next?","I have previously entered the UK as a tourist, in 2007 for 20 days. Last month I applied for a Standard visa to visit my brother who is temporarily resident in the UK. My brother has his own home there so I would not incur accommodation charges for my visit. With my application I submitted:

Invitation letter from my brother in which he mentioned all food and travel expenses will be borne by him and I would stay with him in his own home.
My brother's bank statement (approx £3k closing balance), his property papers, passport copy, visa copy, National Insurance copy, telephone expense copy, pay slips, letter from his current employer that he wants to invite his brother to the UK (same documents for my sister-in-law).
My bank statement (~INR 200,000 closing balance), three months of salary slips, NOC from my employer regarding my visit to UK and leave approval, my appointment letter and job confirmation letter.

However my application was rejected:


I had a return air ticket booked seven months previously but forgot to submit it.
After seven days I reapplied with additional documentation:

After a further deposit of INR 190,000, a bank statement showing a closing balance of INR 390,000 and a covering letter explaining that my mother is partially sponsoring me for the trip and that the additional deposit was her gift.
New invitation letter from my brother where he accepts full responsibility and guarantees I will return to India on the date of my return flight.
My confirmed return tickets.

My application was again rejected on the following grounds:

My salary is 25k and they are not convinced. 
I am not able to provide enough evidence due to which they rejected earlier
INR 190,000 deposited in my account but they are not convinced that this is from my mother and doubt my financial situation.
They are not sure that my sponsor (my brother) will take full responsibility/guarantee that I will return to India.

Moreover they mentioned that no one is stopping my brother from visiting India and there are other modes of communication where we can connect.
I don't know what to do to convince them I am a genuine visitor. I don't have any intention of overstaying as I have a pretty decent job in India and own a home and a vehicle. Why would I become a defaulter?

I don't intend on swimming or going to an onsen, however im wondering whether we will have any trouble getting into our hotels in Tokyo and Osaka which we have already paid for( They are both 4 star hotels, if that matters so presumably lots of foreigners have been there), should I just wear long sleeve shirts my whole time in Japan? I would have liked to get a temporary gym membership for 7-10 days while I was in Japan nearby the hotel, but I am not really sure whether my tattoo will pose a problem.
TLDR: Should I ask the hotels beforehand if they will have a problem with my tattoo on my forearm, and places like the gym, restaurants, just walking around be a problem? If so I guess I can just wear long sleeved shirts the whole time :(

UK visa refusal on V 4.2 a + c (and sometimes 'e'),"Many of the UK visa refusals we see here share a common pattern and the prevailing reasons refer to V 4.2 (a) and (c).  
Here's a composite of images drawn from the archives:

I do understand that, while the applicants may describe very different individual circumstances, there's a consistent pattern and, broadly, fall into specific categories: 

Credibility (lifestyle, lack of ties, visit history, lies & omissions)
Funding (insufficient funds, provenance of funds, funds parking)
Sponsorship (family, friends, employer)

Question: What most commonly triggers a UK visa refusal where V 4.2 (a) and (c) are given as the grounds?
Secondarily: Given that there is a clear pattern, to what extent are these refusals predictable? Does sponsorship make a difference? Is there a set of personal circumstances, however abstract, where a refusal is all but guaranteed? For example, why do those we see here on TSE who sought entry for the PLAB or British Army appear to be refused with a common theme? Is there a uniform shortcoming or is it just discrimination?

PLAB: What is about applications for a visa, for the purpose of sitting the Professional and Linguistic Assessments Board (PLAB) exam, that seem to invite refusals. After all, the test is given so that international medical graduates can show that they qualify to practise medicine in the UK. The first part, PLAB 1, can be taken in centres outside of the UK. However, PLAB 2 can be taken only in the UK. Why can't you can't get a visa just to sit the exam, promising that you'll leave immediately after?   
British Army: Since Commonwealth citizens are eligible to apply online to join, even those who don't reside in the UK, why is it so difficult to get a visa just to attend an interview to see whether you are suitable? Even with an invitation from the Army, such visa applications seem to be unsuccessful. Isn't a career in the British Army a valid reason?  

Lastly:  After such a refusal, what approaches would increase the chance of a successful application?

Are there any formal religious pilgrimage journeys to take in the USA or Canada?,"In Europe, there are specific formalized paths to take when going on many religious, especially Roman Catholic, pilgrimages. In at least some cases, traveling along a specific route is a specific requirement to be considered to have really completed the pilgrimage. One famous literary depiction of a journey-based pilgrimage is found in Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.
There are a lot of shrines, temples, etc. in North America that one can make a religious pilgrimage to, such as the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, but I haven't found any indication that there are any specific travel requirements that one is supposed to meet while getting there, other than perhaps to not commit a mortal sin of road rage while trying to navigate downtown Washington, DC traffic.

I also checked this link and it says the same: https://www.skyteam.com/en/flights-and-destinations/visa-and-health/
But just to be sure, I called up the China Southern office in India and the lady there said that even if the US Government rules allow this, the airline has its own rules for having 6 month passport validity for all travelers and that I may not be allowed to board my flight.
Now I am losing my sleep over this because the cancellation charges are more than my monthly salary (the only reason I was able to book the flight was because of promised reimbursement). And if I cancel after refusal to board, the cancellation charges would shoot up to much more.

Can somebody who may have access to Timatic help me out with information on what Timatic says about my case?

How to spend a night in an unknown city without a hotel? Is there a guide or resource online?,"I had a late flight recently and due to a delay on the flight I was not able to get my transport to the city where I had my accommodation.
Staying in the airport was not an option either since it's a small one and it closes at night. I ended up in a nearby city, without any references and no place to stay.

Note: Some people asked how I knew everything was booked. Actually it's very hard to search for hotels for the same night after 12PM. I can't really tell everything was full, but I inferred it by using booking.com to search for nearby hotels.

Using restroom on airplane while fasten seatbelt light is on?,"This question about Why do flight attendants continue to stand, when the seatbelt set is on? over on aviation.stackexchange.com made me wonder what a passenger is supposed to do when they urgently have to use the restroom while the fasten seat belt light is on.

I saw this happen on a flight where an older gentleman asked the flight attendant if he could use the restroom, and she said ""not until the light is off"". The flight had been free of turbulence for 15 minutes or so by this time, and the flight attendants were walking freely throughout the cabin, collecting post-meal trash, etc. The gentleman who asked to use the restroom appeared to be in quite some discomfort, and practically ran to the restroom when the light went off 10 minutes later.

Is it illegal to vape in Mexico?,"I am going to be studying abroad in Mexico for an entire year. Over the last year I started vaping. I was looking into taking my vape with me to Mexico and I saw a post that said vaping in Mexico was fine but selling the equipment was illegal and another that said vaping was illegal altogether. All of the information I found was in 2015/2016. I cant find anything that is more current.
I was wondering if anyone knew if it was legal to vape there or not. I want to take my equipment with me but I don't want it to be confiscated at the border.

How to make sure that you get off at the correct bus stop in Thailand?,"I find it extremely difficult to get off at the correct bus stop in Thailand, mainly for the reasons as:

The bus stop usually doesn't have a recognizable sign on which stop it is.
Thai characters and its words are pretty hard to make out within just a few seconds for non-natives, while Google Maps only show the name in Thai.
The bus doesn't make an announcement to inform passangers of the next bus stop. This is unlike countries like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, which have also a language barrier but make an announcement in English.
There is no such app available like CityMapper in Bangkok. This is also unlike in Tokyo and Seoul.
There is no electric bulletin board in the bus, that displays where the bus is right now and which is the next station, etc... (unlike Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan).
Counting a number of bus stops might work at times, but this has two main problems as well;

You must keep concentrating on the counting
A bus doesn't stop at every single stop, if no person gets on nor off.

A bus conductor doesn't speak English at all.

Moreover, in some buses you pay to a conductor a varying amount of fares depending on your destination. Thus you should not get off at the wrong bus stop once on board, as it might turn to a different amount of fares.
For me it is a nightmare to take a bus in Thailand (I'm in Bangkok, if it is relevant). How can you, a non-native tourist, make sure you get off at the correct stop? The only clue seems to be that you keep gazing on the Google Maps with GPS turned on, and use your gut instinct to get off at the correct stop...

"US B1/B2 visa application refused without ""strong"" reasons and possible criteria applied","A 47-year-old relative applied for a US B1/B2 visa in Lima, Peru today and completed the DS-160 form specifying the following relevant information:
- That she was divorced for more than 10 years now. 
- That she will travel with her 27-year-old son and that he will be mainly affording the trip costs.
- That her sister is a LPR (Lawful Permanent Resident).
- That her role at work is actually related to business tasks and being in charge of 3 people and also specified her salary (which is way more than the minimum wage for the country).

And, during the interview, the consular officer just asked the following questions (with a terrible attitude, not even saying “hello” and showing at least a bit of respect):
Q: What’s the purpose of the trip?
A: Attend to my sister’s wedding with my son and stay for 5 days in Florida.

Q: Who will afford the trip costs?
A: I will, but my son will primarily do it (I have papers to demonstrate his funds and job if you want to take a look).

Q: Does your son have a US visa?
A: Yes, he does.

Then, the consular officer just said “Ah, your son have a US visa” (she took note of something in the system) and told my relative that her application was refused under ""Section 214(b) of the US immigration and Nationality Act"" and gave her a paper “explaining the reasons” of the decision. 
After that, my relative asked the consular officer what was the specific reason of the refusal and she just told her to read the paper that she gave to her - which actually says nothing and we all know it’s just a formalism and contains too abroad information - then my relative replied “but the paper says nothing” and the consular officer just stopped talking.

Having said that, my questions would be:
1. What could be the criteria, in this particular case, for refusing my relative’s visa application (based on your experience, since I can't really understand) and how is it possible for a consular officer to determine whether or not you are eligible for a visa with such basic questions and without even having reviewed the necessary information.
2. Based on the previous information, can I assume that my relative got her visa application refused because of the “attitude” of the consular officer and do you think it’s a good idea to re-apply soon? 
3. Is there a way to complain about any US consular officer’s attitude? (or again, if the option exists, it’s just a facade like the paper that they give you when refusing your visa application).

Particularly, I find all this unfair and totally inaccurate to determine who is eligible for a US visa or not and, compared to other embassies, their “method” is just lame but this is my personal opinion (at the end it feels as if the applicant is playing a roulette game).

"Whilst on ESTA I was stamped a 6 month B2 visa, would this be considered overstaying?","I flew to Houston early last year on an ESTA waiver, and upon arrival the officer stamped me in writing B2 on my stamp with 6 months'of validity. 
I stayed for one month and then travelled overland to Canada. I border hoped 2 weeks later to get a Canadian work permit and upon entering the U.S. for the hop the officer stamped me again putting 3 month validity. 
I then spent six weeks in Canada working before going on a 2 week roadtrip to the U.S., returning to Canada for another month and then, returning once again to the U.S., on the date that the 3 month visa was to expire. I asked the guard what that meant and he just told me according to the 6 month visa I was stamped I was fine, I'm not sure if he knew the rules but by this point I was ultra confused. I was in the U.S. Then up until a week before my 6 month visa expired. I then returned back to Canada and flew home from there.
I just got an email from ESTA saying that my two years is about to expire and I need to apply for a new one. I intend to return to the U.S. in a couple of months so I have a few questions. 
Did I actually overstay and if so do I have a valid reason due to the mistakes of officers?
Was my ESTA activated on the date of my arrival in Houston or on the second time I arrived? If the former, would the second officer had stamped the wrong date also?
Would me being a temporary resident in Canada throughout this have any impact?
Do they record all movement between the U.S and Canada electronically? I recall multiple times coming and going and the officers not scanning my passport, only checking it as ID. This would be notable especially on the trip that I returned to the U.S. on the expired date, wouldn't that have flagged them?
Since I flew out of Canada and not the U.S. does that prevent them from knowing my true departure? And if I did get screwed over and get flagged because of all of this, would me flying into Canada and crossing over to the U.S. overland bar me, even though they don't seem to even check the passports there?
This is probably really confusing, it's confusing to me. I thought I was doing the right thing until I read about overstaying ESTA on here.

early morning rental car drop-off - sacramento international airport,"I have an early morning flight (05:30) from Sacramento International Airport. Security at the airport opens at 04:00, rental car office opens at 05:00 but rental car company says out-of-hours drop-off is available.
Question is about practicalities of drop-off so that I can evaluate whether it is better to drop off the night before and rely on hotel shuttle or drop-off early morning. Two questions:

I've never used out-of-hours drop off at any US rental location. Practically, how does this work? I am guessing that one drives into the lot. Leaves keys in some drop off box, takes luggage and walks. Net: time for this should be even less than normal drop-off. I'm using Hertz if it makes a difference to the answer.
What is the early morning shuttle like at Sacramento Airport, any experiences? I understand that this is a common shuttle across all rental companies and other transit. The shuttle is documented as running 24h, but I failed to find any frequency information. 

My current thinking for early morning drop-off there's no point in arriving much before 04:00 and I could allow 30 minutes for transfer to Terminal A, should nicely make 05:30 flight.
On balance I think it would be simpler to drop-off the night before, only reason I can think of not to do this is that Holiday Inn site says that shuttle availability is limited.

Does the accessory even have a maximum size? It doesn't appear to be listed. They speak about shoulder bags, but I got a 35L I wouldn't mind taking with me. I'll stay under the weight, does that give me the all-clear?

UK visitor visa refused due to previously staying for too long and not having strong ties. How should I reapply?,"I had applied for a UK visa recently and it got refused. My trip was funded by my brother and sister so financially it should have been no problem. The reasons for refusal were:

I have refused your application for a visit visa because I am not satisfied that you meet the requirements of paragraph 4.2 of appendix V:Immigration rules for visitor because:

You have stated that you intend  to travel to the UK for 6 weeks to visit your brother.
I acknowledge that you have travelled to the UK before. I also note that on that occasion you stated that you would also stay for 6 weeks and ended up in the UK for four months. It is unclear how you were able to take such a lengthy period away from your studies and what you did in the UK for that period of time.
I have to consider your circumstances when assessing your application. The evidence that you have provided with your application does not demonstrate your own circumstance. I understand that you state you're a student and as such do not have employment but the evidence that you have submitted does not indicate how you are able to meet the day to day cost of living. As you have provided no evidence of your financial circumstances it is very difficult for me to assess your financial standing in your home country.
Additionally, you do not appear to have any saving, income or assets of your own. On the balance of probabilities I am not satisfied that you have demonstrated that you have strong family and financial ties to your home country which would encourage you to leave the UK should you be granted entry.
In light of the above and on the balance of probabilities, I am not satisfied that you are genuinely seeking entry as a visitor for a limited period not exceeding 6 month or that you intend to leave the UK at the end of the visit as required by Appendix V 4.2(a)and(c) of the Immigration Rules.

Future Applications
Any future UK visa application you make will be considered on their individual merits, however you are likely to be refused unless the circumstances of your application change.

I'm confused on what I read; I do not know what to do.
What was wrong with my application?
What do I need to provide in addition to other documents to ensure that I get the visa?
What was wrong with my application and what corrective steps should I take for my next application?

Is there a limit on how many Single Entry Visas I can get for Thailand per year?,"Is it possible to get multiple Single Entry Thai Tourist Visas per year?
I am currently considering going to Thailand 2-3 times in the next 12 months:

August/September for Kitesurfing in Ko Pha Ngan
December-February for Kitesurfing in Hua Hin
February-March for Kitesurfing in Hua Hin

2./3. are the most important to me, but if possible I would also like to go the 1. time.
I am simply planning to go as a Tourist, I don't intend to do any kind of work in Thailand. I would apply for the Multiple Entry Thai Tourist Visa, but am currently staying in Japan and don't intend to go back to my home country before. I understand I can only apply for the Multiple Entry Tourist Visa in places where I can claim residence. 
I have entered Thailand the last time on 28th of December 2016 and stayed the maximum amount of possible days: 97 (60 day tourist Visa + 30 day extension + 7 day extension).
I am a German citizen/digital nomad being paid from the US.

Enter Ireland as non-visa national and proceed to UK - what is the allowed duration of stay?,"I am a non-visa national planning to visit Ireland and the UK with entry through Ireland and onward to UK without passing through immigration control.
Does the duration of stay I am given in Ireland cover my total stay in the Common Travel Area? Basically if I am unfortunate and say given only 1 week upon entry into Ireland (instead of the standard 90 days), do I have to depart the UK before the 1 week is up, or do I automatically get the standard 90 day leave to enter once I cross over into UK?
This much I know:

When someone transits via Dublin into the UK they do so on a 90 day leave-to-enter issued by the Republic of Ireland. This allows the holder to move about the Common Travel Area.
The leave-to-enter does not automatically become a six-month UK
  leave-to-enter by crossing a border. Regardless of where they are the
  person becomes an overstayer on the 91st day.

Where can one find Plus ATMs in rural Taiwan?,"When I got to Taipei, my card worked with the ATMs I find, so I did not think much of it. Now that I am starting to circle Taiwan clockwise, I am have not yet found an ATM that accepts Plus cards. Keelung, Jiufen and Xincheng, so far no luck and am getting low on cash. Even places that accept cards like the 7-11 for purchases (Tried Keelung and Xincheng) did not accept my Plus cards nor Mastercard or VISA.

Is there an hotel price search engine that also searches nearby cities?,"I use often booking search engines or price comparison for hotels.
One feature I miss is the possibility to search in nearby cities. Either specifying a radius or by system suggestion. Most times I don't mind staying in a nearby city/location if prices are good enough and good transport connections exist.
I know I can do several searches but it would be nicer if the system sugested and shows one listing only instead of having to iterate through several listings and looking at maps for nearby cities.
Is there an hotel search engine that gives this information?

Dual citizenship. Am I eligible to travel to the US via the Visa Waiver Program,"So I'm planning to go to the US in December. I have dual citizenship, South Africa and Portugal.

How can I view all of the flights in/out of two cities across all dates?,"I believe that the standard routes of carriers between two semi-major US cities always maintain the same route number (e.g. UA3271), and day of the week. I'm looking at planning travel for an interview, so dates are [currently] quite flexible (as in at least one month's range). Since that's the case, there are other constraints that go into my choice of flights. One would be the option to fly out of my home city, land in the interview location, conduct the interview, and fly out in the same day. I figure: if I can view the schedule for flights (i.e. routes) between the two cities, I can make an educated request for days of travel. Yes, I could likely work with the interview scheduler (and I will), but I'd like to be proactive in suggesting some dates to achieve my goal, as well as learn this skill for myself in the future. Thus:
Where can I view the daily routes and times for flights between two cities, on whatever rotating basis (e.g. day of the week) they may be on?

Is there at least one country where short-term visitors cannot use a visa in their old passport?,"We often get questions about whether or not country X allows people to travel there with a new passport and a visa in their old passport. But is there at least one country where either:

Short-term visitors cannot visit the country with a visa in their old passport, or
Timatic's database explicitly prohibits visas in old passports

If all countries allow traveling with a visa in an old passport, travelers could safely travel everywhere in such a manner without worries.

Absolute cheapest transport from Malaysia to Singapore with e-ticket that can be bought online from overseas?,"I need an international e-ticket out of Malaysia to show to the airline when I board next week with a one-way ticket.
Last year I bought a second class train ticket from KL to Woodlands for about $10.
This time for fun and variety and a new little challenge I'd like to find an even cheaper ticket.
I do not care where in Malaysia I get on, nor where in Singapore I get off!
I know what I'm doing. I enjoy travelling this way. Please do not tell me it's easier to do it another way. I don't care about easy. I'm asking specifically about absolute cheapest.
I'm sure I can board the same train from Johor Baru to Woodlands for less money and I'm sure I can book it online at the same website.
But last year when I crossed the border going north I did so on a bus that was basically just a shuttle since you can't cross the border on foot and seemed to be used mostly by shoppers.
Can I book an e-ticket on this bus online from Australia? Or is there any other cheap service just across the border? Which service is the cheapest that I can buy online from home and get a printed e-ticket for?

Can I still use my South Africa passport to travel to South Africa after becoming a New Zealand citizen?,"I was born in South Africa then migrated to New Zealand. Before I obtained my NZ citizenship, we had to renew my South African Passport. At the moment I have a valid NZ passport (expires end of this year) and a valid S.A passport (expires in 5 years). 
I was over 18 years old when we applied for NZ citizenship and did not send any additional paperwork in to hold on to my S.A citizenship. So I don't have Dual-citizenship. 
My S.A passport still has my NZ Permanent Residency paperwork in it which we needed to obtain NZ citizenship.
With this new Visa Requirements that came in force, it's going to take too long to get a Visa on my NZ passport to enter S.A. We have a family emergency and need to fly out ASAP.
Can I still use my S.A. passport to travel to S.A and back to NZ even though I have not retained my citizenship in S.A? Or would I get into trouble at the border for using my S.A passport while not having citizenship there? Or even worse denied entry to NZ because I did not use my NZ passport to come back into the country?
