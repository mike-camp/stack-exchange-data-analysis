Pretzel burger buns: how to make soft crust?,"According to pretzel bread recipe, raw dough buns must be dipped for 30 seconds into a water with baking soda before going into the over in order for them to develop that pretzel brown crust, but it also seems to make the crust quite hard.

Delayed Pressure Canning by 12 hours? OK? or no?,"We did a batch of canning the other day. We take our beans and blanch them then let them cool off. We take our mason jars and boil them as well as our lids. We take the jars out of the boiling water, add our beans, and then fill the jar with boiling water (leaving head room at the top). We then take the full and closed jars and put them in the pressure canner for 25 min with the top shaking/rocking. Then let them sit in the canner for probably another 30ish min until the pressure is gone and we then let them sit on the counter until they cool completely (hours later). 
Here is the question. We did multiple batches that night and it got so late that our last batch we decided to wait until morning to pressure can them. So they sat on the counter for maybe 12 hours max before they were put into the pressure canner the next morning. The lids were on tight and they seemed to be sealed. The only variation from our normal canning procedure was waiting 12 hours before putting them in the pressure canner. Are these still safe to eat? We are concerned that by waiting bacteria could have grown and that it wont be killed from the pressure canning. If these were yours, would you throw them out? Or keep them?

Is eating olive pits a problem?,"I have been eating fresh and brined olives for years. I like the olives with the pits and usually consume the whole pit without removing it. It was recently pointed out to me that this is not a healthy practice, and even though I have been doing this for some time, I began to wonder whether it is 1)abnormal to eat the whole olive, pit and all, and 2) will the pits have a long term adverse effect? I have never met anyone who ate olive pits, and I find the pitted olives to be the best, so I thought I would ask.

Sous Vide effectiveness of trapping residual air above water bath?,"(Note: this is a continuation of this question: Sous vide effectiveness without using a vacuum sealer?)
What is the scientific impact of trapping small amounts of residual air in a pocket above the water bath?  This assumes that there is still a very strong thermal coupling between the water bath and sous vide item. 
In the photo below, you can see at least a 2-inch gap between the air pockets above water level and the actual short ribs. The food does not float. 
From a heat transfer perspective, I can't imagine that a vacuum sealed bag can perform significantly better—certainly not relative to a 48hr cook time. 

Is there (scientifically) something fundamental about vacuum pressure with sous vide, or is it only continuous, stable heat-transfer? What kind of ""oxidation causing off flavors or promote spoilage"" is possible in the described scenario? 
Is there a possibility of bacterial contamination? 
What would happen if I cut a small hole in the bag above the water level and let the trapped air escape--as long as the food does not float and water does not leak in?

Are hardware store themocouples food safe?,"I recently finished reading The Blue Bottle Craft of Coffee: Growing, Roasting, and Drinking, with Recipes. The authors of this book put a strong emphasis on accurate measurements and measuring tools, both for coffee and baking, and regularly make use of general purpose thermocouples as shown in the excerpt and picture below:

One of the greatest kitchen gadgets you can have is a thermocouple (shown below). A thermocouple is an electronic temperature sensor that can be purchased at the hardware store, and is typically used in science and industry for testing the temperature of ovens and air conditioning. They’re fairly inexpensive, absolutely accurate, and very easy to use and clean. I use mine for verifying my oven temperature and for taking temperature readings on sugar syrups and other temperature-sensitive recipes, such as Homemade Yogurt. It’s an invaluable and extremely accurate tool that is worth investing in for both baking and coffee preparation.

"Can you make fermented, oil-stored Giardiniera at home?","I'm wanting to try to make Chicago-style giardiniera at home. However, some food-safety site says that 

The Italian condiment, Giardiniera, CANNOT be made safely at home. This mixture of raw, hot peppers and vegetables in an oil base can support the growth of Clostridium botulinum. Therefore low-acid foods, such as vegetables, that are mixed with oil must be kept refrigerated. They can be kept refrigerated for up to 10 days. Commercially prepared products contain specific levels of microbial inhibitors or acidifying vegetables for use in an oil-based product in the home environment.

Most recipes I look up for fermented giard are touting it's mystic gut-flora curative powers, and don't discuss storing it under oil. The oil recipes I find just have the vegetables soaked in brine for a day, while refrigerated, so practically nothing microbial is going to happen there.
As to the warnings, I'm not sure if the ""low-acid foods [...] that support the growth of Clostridium"" include fermented vegetables. From what I can tell, fermented vegetables are more likely to be attacked (in the short-term) by mold, and only if oxygen gets in.
The ""proper"" Chicago recipe is cited in the Tribune article as broadly:

According to Shay of Local Foods, making Chicago-style giardiniera is a two-step process. ""First, you pickle the vegetables,"" he says. Then, ""you drain everything, and then cover (the vegetables) with oil."" Shay lets the vegetables pickle for two weeks before tossing them in the oil, where he leaves them to infuse for another two weeks.

Cast Aluminum Vs Cast iron Dutch Oven,"I have seen a lot of meat roasting recipes that require using Dutch ovens, most of the cooks doing the presentations have enameled cast iron Dutch ovens.
When I looked into what a Dutch oven is I noticed some internet sites are suggesting that there are cast aluminium Dutch Ovens as well, They are popular in the Caribbean and are sometimes called Dutch Pots.
I have seen the question: What to look for when choosing a dutch oven?, with an answer suggesting two material options. Plain (seasoned) cast iron or enameled cast iron. Cast aluminium was not mentioned at all. I would like someone to talk about cast aluminium Dutch pots a little because pots made from that material are much cheaper and easier for me to get. The only reason why I would not bother with cast aluminium is if it does a very poor job with meat roasting and caramelization of sugar.
Here are some of the things I already know or at least think I know:

The thermal capacity of the  cast aluminium compared to that of cast iron will lead to a cast iron pot having superior temperature stability for the same thickness and size.
Cast aluminium is lighter than cast iron, volume constant hence lighter pot for same size.
Cast aluminium Dutch pots are durable and cheap and easier to care for
Cast aluminium will probably react with some food items while enameled cast iron will be safer in this regard
The melting point of cast aluminium is lower than that of cast iron

Have I left any key issues out?
What are the likely problems with my output if I choose the aluminium pot given the above points where aluminium does not do well and the fact that I need the pot mainly for meat roasting and sugar caramelization stove top?

After eating a few slices I noticed something different from what I eat at a restaurant. I see some white fluidy solid in my sauce plate, which is possibly fat. I washed the flesh and applied juice from squeezed lemon to it before eating. I'd never met this phenomenon before.

What's that white fluid in fresh salmon flesh? (No quality issues)
Is it fat? It does not dissolve in water or sauce.
How is this fresh salmon different from that in a restaurant?
How should I process the salmon so that it gets consistent with the one in a restaurant? Or simplifying this question, how can I get rid of the ""fat"" (since there's no other issue)?

How can I make my kefir milk smooth and creamy instead of watery and grainy?,"Just started making kefir last week.  My kefir comes out grainy and watery.
Here is what I'm doing:

I have about 2 tablespoon of kefir
I add about 4 cups of 2% organic milk
Leave it for a day on the counter (26 degrees centigrade)
It separates by this time (clear liquid at the bottom) but not much
I run it through a plastic sieve.

The resulting kefir compared to store bought kefir (my only point of reference) is:

seems watery instead of creamy
seems grainy: tiny grains almost like yogurt particles
has a sharp taste/smell

I still drink it and enjoy it.  But I was wondering how I can improve it...

I haven't gotten the timing right yet...however switching to whole milk is producing much better kefir.

Does storing meat in plastic alter how long it takes to go off?,"I was recently told quite emphatically that ""Storing meat in plastic makes it spoil faster""
I suspect that this is an old wives tale, but haven't been able to find anything that either proves or disproves the statement.
I was told that it's true whether it's plastic from packaging(say, plastic bags for sliced ham, a chicken in cling-film...anything.) or if the meat is being stored in Tupperware.
Assume that the meat is stored in a fridge.
It wasn't suggested that it was caused by anything leaching from the plastic, like BPA.
If this is either true or false, I would really like to know why?
Many thanks!

"Frying Steak - disappointing gray crust, not pink inside","Ok so I'm a teenager and I'm starting to get interested in this cooking thing, and in particular, steak. 
So anyway, this past week I decided to try my luck at preparing a steak. My family's grill is broken, so I tried to cook it in a pan (after reading and watching plenty of articles and videos on how to cook steak).
So I used some sort of heavy metal pan (I'm not sure what material), and let it heat up on high heat for about 5 minutes. After letting my 3 thin flank steaks sit out for around 30 minutes, I put salt, pepper, and olive oil on them. Next, I put them in the pan and immediately the room filled with smoke.
I opened up windows, doors, and used the vent above the pan but to no avail. Despite all the smoke, the steaks would only seem to turn a bland grey. After a while I had to take them off because I didn't want them to get overdone.
I put the steaks on a plate and covered them with tin foil. After around 10 minutes, I cut into them and they only had a little pink in them. Not the medium rare I was hoping for. Plus, there was the disappointing gray crust.
What did I do wrong? Any help is appreciated.

Gari as subtitutes for tapioca,"I used to make a lot of cakes using tapioca flour. Now I've moved to another country and rarely stumbled upon the flour in the supermarket.

Xanthan gum in bread baking,"I was under the impression that Xanthan Gum could be used in bread in order to increase the hydration and make it fluffier. I have tried it three times (0.5% - 1% of flour weight) in two different recipes (croissants and regular buns), but the dough was not noticeably easier to work with, nor did it rise quite as much as normally. (I did not do a controlled test, so it's hard to pinpoint the cause.)
I know that Xanthan Gum is normally used in gluten free bread, but that's not what I'm after here. I have read (but can't remember the source) that it can be used in regular bread to make the crumb airier, but in my limited experiments, that does not appear to be the case.

Jello and Evaporated Milk Dessert,"In the 50s, my mother used to whip Jello and Evaporated milk together, pour it into single serve bowls and refrigerate.  The result was a creamy foam that separated into two layers, forming a lighter foam on top.  She always said it was simple to make but never taught me how she made it.  I've tried simply stirring the Jello into boiling water to dissolve, cooling to room temperature and before it sets up, adding the evaporated milk and beating but it doesn't work.  I've been looking for a very long time but all the recipes I find are much more complicated than this simple, elegant foam.  I'm thinking she may have halved the amount of water the Jello box calls for.  Maybe she whipped the milk separately and then added the dissolved Jello?  Has anyone heard of this?  If so, how is it made and does it have a name?

"Does fish blood have a smell, how to remove it?","truly fresh fish should not smell of anything except sea water.  I've been buying fresh sardines however when I take it out of the bag there seems to be a smell, it seems to be originating from liquid, blood, and the fish.  even after cooking i can sometimes taste this smell.
Note this smell could be from blood, paper wrapping or something else but i think its the fish and blood.  

with fresh fish which shouldnt smell of anything except sea water, is it normal for its blood to smell?
does one remove the smell by thorough washing or does it need to be heated to a particular temp to remove, if so what is the temp?

Now I'm onto the meat. Its a pork, beef, and veal mixture.
My question is, do I need to cook the mixture before stuffing into the ravioli? If I do cook it, I'm worried the fat in the meat will make it so that everything won't stick together and therefore be harder to stuff.
On the other hand If I don't cook the meat, I'm worried the raviolis will have to cook too long for the filling to be cooked and the pasta will be way overcooked.

Did I turn my frosting into mayonnaise?,"A few weeks ago I made a European-ish buttercream with roughly these ingredients:
4 large whole eggs plus two yolks;
~1.5 cups of white sugar;
~1T vanilla bean paste (I scraped out the rest of my jar);
5 sticks of salted butter (I like salted butter. Haters gonna hate.)
I beat it over a double-boiler until it was foamy, cooking it to at least 140F. Then I transferred it over to the stand-mixer, beat it until it was cool to the touch, added the butter bit by bit, and continued to beat it until soft and fluffy. It was perfect for my affogato cupcakes.
Half an hour ago, I made a lemon-polenta loaf, but I don't like powdered sugar glazes, so I thought I'd beat a bunch of lemon juice and lemon juice powder into some of the left-over vanilla buttercream living in my fridge. I did that, and the texture is weirdly reminiscent of mayonnaise. Not bad, just noticeable.
And when I thought about it, I realised it has all the necessary components. Eggs, oil (in this case just butter), and acid (about a tablespoon each of King Arthur lemon juice powder and fresh lemon juice). The eggs and oil were already emulsified, which seems to be the hardest part of mayonnaise-making, and I just beat the acid into my preexisting emulsion. Except for the vanilla and lots of sugar, it fits the definition (I think).
So my question is, could I, in fact have turned my fancy buttercream into mayonnaise? Or is this just a trick of texture? Is there any way I can tell for sure with a little I save out? If it's not mayonnaise, then why not?
Corollary-type question: If this is mayonnaise, would there be anyway to make a tart European-ish buttercream without it turning into mayonnaise...?

How to make chocolate milk,"I have tried making hot cocoa with melted chocolate. Here is how I did it:
Heat up some milk in a mug until it is hot(ceramic tends to do better in microwaves than glass does because it doesn't conduct heat as well as glass does.)
Put half milk chocolate and half dark chocolate(I was trying to go for that bittersweet and semisweet chocolate by using milk chocolate and dark chocolate) in a small thin glass container and melt it completely(not to the point of separation though)
Put a little bit of the hot milk in the chocolate to temper it(same way you temper eggs).
Stir the chocolate into the milk. Now this chocolate was hershey's brand and I used 4 pieces of the milk chocolate and 4 pieces of the dark chocolate.
Keep stirring until it is the same color as chocolate milk or darker.
Now doing it this way I thought ""Milk has fat and water and chocolate has water soluble components and fat soluble components so it should be all good with no separation.
However it did separate and there was a little bit(about an 1/8 of an inch of cocoa butter at the top.
However you can't homogenize chocolate like you can homogenize milk.
Now my thought on why it didn't work is because I used 2% reduced fat milk(which means fat is reduced by 2 percent not to 2%) and so there was too little fat.
Even though it was only reduced by a little in terms of fat content, that little bit it was reduced by might be important to prevent separation. However I didn't want to go with organic milk because I know that organic milk separates into water and cream.
So if I want to make hot cocoa using chocolate or make chocolate milk should I go with whole milk and melt the chocolate over the milk in a double boiler or what?

How can I get my bacon less salty?,"I was reading this question, and there's a solution to the OP's answer. I'm not fond of salt and this is a drawback for bacon (to me, that is). I do want to end up with pieces of cooked bacon (so mixing in milk or less bacon won't work), but less salty. Where I live, we also don't have 10 brands of bacon, so choosing the brand with the smallest amount of salt isn't good enough.
Is there a way that I can reduce the saltiness of bacon?
I don't care about the actual salt percentage. I'm curious about salt perception, so masking up the salt would be nice.

Coriander/cilantro: did it smell/taste stronger in the past?,"I am a big fan of fresh coriander and its lovely fragrant flavour. But nowadays (in the UK at least) coriander seems incredibly bland.

I have a ""modern"" supermarket-bought coriander plant right here, and it might as well be flatleaf parsley*, it is so bland and pointless. I can rub, smoosh or chew a leaf, and the resulting aroma/flavour is almost undetectable.

"""Akiko's special jam""—or, making a bright yellow preserve","In a couple of months, I will be attending a housewarming hosted a friend who is a big fan of Key/Visual Arts anime. In honour of this, I plan to recreate an infamous—albeit fictional—recipe: Akiko's special jam.

It would be silly (and rather cruel!) to try and reproduce the recipe from the show; this is left intentionally ambiguous and is known to be quite unenjoyable. Instead, I plan to make something which reproduces some of the key characteristics while remaining palatable.
Main goals
These are my objectives in order of importance:

It must be suitable for vegetarians.
It must be bright, vibrant yellow. (Gold/orange are acceptable but not preferred.)
There should be no obvious chunks, seeds or discolourations.
The consistency should be thick but largely smooth.
Rather than appearing to be a thick puree, it should have the syrupy translucency of a traditional jam or jelly.
It should be a novel but enjoyable accompaniment for a sandwich.
Preferably, it should not be overly sweet—though I am willing to compromise on this for aesthetics.

Where I need help
The main questions I'm debating and would like some help with are:

What ingredients can I use for the desired colour and taste?
What type of preserve works best with those ingredients?
What techniques, tips or tricks could help me obtain the desired consistency and appearance?

I am a novice to jam-making and have only tried my hand at it a couple of times, so any ideas, direction or commentary will be very much appreciated.
What I've considered already
I will be trialling and refining recipes well in advance but would like to narrow down the candidates before I start experimenting. Here are some of my initial thoughts:

Yellow pumpkin/squash: I've seen recipes which get pretty close to the desired colour, though less jelly-like than I would prefer—and it would certainly taste interesting.
Yellow tomato jam/chutney: just the flesh without seeds may work well and should taste interesting; however, I'm unsure how well it would hold its colour and I'm unsure how hard it would be to get the right consistency.
Mango chutney: this would be quite sweet, unfortunately, but I've seen several recipes online that look very similar in appearance and texture to what I'm trying to achieve. Another drawback is that it may not work well on sandwiches.
Kaya: this would absolutely be sweeter than I want, but it is also delicious, unusual to Western tastes and can be made to look pretty bright. I'm concerned that it may be more opaque than what I'm going for, however.
Lemon curd: this would do in a pinch, but is still very sweet and a bit pedestrian.
Jam vs jelly vs curd vs chutney vs…: I'm keeping my options open about what sort of preserve to make, and am not sure which would work best.

Confusion about chicken leg & thighs nutrition facts (calories),"First of all, the nutrition facts given by USDA doesn't make sense to me. I'll refer only to skinless facts. Chicken breasts have 120kcal and chicken legs have the same. I know chicken breast have more protein and less fat, however I think chicken legs are much fattier.
When the are roasted, chicken legs have a higher caloric value (174 kcal) than breasts (165 kcal). The same applies for chicken thighs, which have very similar values. 
I tried to calculate the amount of nutrients/calories in a chicken leg, but I got incongruent results.
I weighted full chicken headquarters without skin and it was 266g. I bake it in the oven at 400F/200C for 40 minutes and it reached and internal temperature of 200F/93C.
Cooked weight was 225g. Bones was 64g. Therefore:

Raw meat: 266-64 = 202g ; 202g * 120kcal/100g = 242 kcal
Cooked meat: 225-64 = 161g ; 161g * 174kcal/100g = 280 kcal

So 280 kcal / 202g raw meat = 139 kcal / 100g raw meat

Why didn't they match? I think the are very well done, so they should have lost a lot of water. But they would have to lose more water so the calories match (In particular meat would have to weight 139g cooked).

Why does the roux separate from my gumbo?,"I love gumbo, and make it about once or twice a month. However, I've noticed that my roux will occasionally separate from my stew and float up to the surface. I've sampled it, just to see if it had absorbed some of the flavors, but all I got was a floury taste. 
I've had gumbo enough times to know that this shouldn't be happening - the roux should be enriching the flavor of the stew and mixing in, but it isn't.
A rough outline of what I do:

Make roux with vegetable oil and flour in a 1:1 ratio.
Mix in bell pepper, celery, and onions (aka ""trinity""); stir frequently for 10-20 minutes.
Mix in garlic, cayenne pepper; stir for two minutes.
Mix in thyme, bay leaves, white wine; bring to boil.
Add chicken, andouille, shrimp, tomatoes, clam juice, chicken broth; bring to boil and simmer for 30 minutes.
Add okra; simmer for 10 minutes or until ready to serve.

Here's some thoughts on possible problems:

I usually cook it in a slow cooker once I have all the ingredients simmering. I've only cooked it the conventional way (read: in a pot) once, and it didn't separate. (When I cooked it in the pot, some of the roux was in the stew that boiled off the top of the lid; a tasting revealed that it was more flavorful than the stew).

2. I've sometimes gotten lazy or been in a rush, so I only cook the trinity for 10 minutes instead of the full 20. (I've also noticed that the trinity gets uncomfortably slimy-looking after the 10 minutes, which has prompted me to prematurely move to the next step on a few occasions.)
And finally, an error I am not making: I am not burning the roux. It may smell smoky, but it is not burned.
Given this, what could be the cause?
EDIT: I've just made it again, and it's definitely not because I'm undercooking the trinity. Based on the evidence, I'm going to go with Sobachatina's answer, until I can try it again.
SOLUTION: Forgot to update this until I got pinged about a change on this question. The slow cooker made the roux separate from the gumbo; it has never separated from the stew when cooked in a pot, likely because the starch doesn't fully gelatinize when in the slow cooker. If anyone wants to look further and try to figure out when the starch is sufficiently gelatinized, drop a comment below with your result and I'll update this solution.

Sugar/Citric Acid Coating giving Gummy Bears a Wet Look,"So I'm able to make my gummy bear recipe just fine. Its just a simple mix of the following:
1/2 Cup water
1/4 Corn Syrup
1 6oz package of Jell-O Brand gelatin
2 packages of gelatin (Out of the four pack boxes)

I'm assuming you know how to make this recipe into bears at this point as this question isn't about the recipe more so the coating. However this recipe is from the ever so popular gummy bear video on YouTube found here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3_dV-e4d9c
So the bears are made, chilled, came out great. No issues. Except they're definitely not AS clear as the YouTube video, but again not really the point. Taste fine, and are firm.
So, I add a PURE sugar coating, let them sit out for a day, and harden up. They're good to go. Its a solid dry sugar coating similar to sour patch kids, or those little orange or cherry slices you get at the gas station.
However I wanted to create some type of sour coating similar to sour patch kids. I tried buying this product here:
https://www.walmart.com/ip/UBO-Citric-Acid-7-5-Ounce-USA/647638748
Its Ball Jar brand Citric Acid. I added this to a 1:3 ratio of citric acid to sugar, and then coated my gummy bears. After letting sit out for a day to dry up and harden, i come back to the gummy bears looking wet, sticky, and not easily handled.
I'm wondering if anyone has any advice to solve this problem. Its my first time posting here, so hopefully someone can help. :P

Can I freeze a partially seared piece of steak for reheating in the oven later?,"This question refers specifically to the recipe found here:
https://www.kitchenkonfidence.com/2012/02/frozen-seared-steak
which I'll quote for the complete reference:

This recipe starts with a beautiful slab of frozen porterhouse steak. 
  The steak is seared in a screaming hot cast iron skillet then finished
  in a 200°F oven until done to taste.  The whole process is quite easy
  and results in a perfectly cooked steak.  The contrast of the salty,
  golden crust and the smooth, buttery center is just pure heaven. 
  Freezing the steak in advance will ensure that you don’t overcook the
  meat while you achieve that perfect sear.  This recipe is also easily
  scalable for a dinner party.  Sear each steak one at a time and then
  finish them all off in the oven at the same time!
[...]

Cover the steak in plastic wrap (or butcher paper) and place in the
  freezer for 1 hour. 
Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 200°F and place a rack in the center of the oven. 
After freezing for an hour, season the steak with a generous amount of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. 
Place a cast iron skillet over a high flame and heat until screaming hot (at least 10 minutes). Add a thin layer of safflower oil
  then quickly but carefully set the steak in the skillet. Sear one side
  only until golden brown. Press the steak down with tongs to get an
  even sear. Alternatively, you can set a heavy bottomed pot or press on
  top of the steak to get a nice even crust.
Transfer the steak, seared side up, to a rimmed baking sheet and place in the oven. Cook until done to taste (30 minutes - 1 hour). An
  internal temperature of 125 for rare, 145 for medium and 165 for well
  done. 
Let stand for 10 minutes covered in a aluminum foil before thinly slicing. Season with a sprinkle of kosher salt.


Now, my question is: 
I travel to a remote location for work and stay there during the week and have dinner there. We usually just eat at the local restaurants but lately I've been trying to save some time by preparing frozen meals in advance. The workplace doesn't have any cooking tools but it does have a freezer and an oven. So I'm thinking of a slight modification to this recipe as follows:
After taking the steak out of the freezer and searing the first side, could I then let cool and refreeze the steak for later cooking in the oven ? The idea is that when I'm ready to serve them on another day, I could simply take the 1-side-seared steaks and stick them in the oven without needing a skillet and cooking setup to sear the 1 side. This way when I'm home I could batch sear 1 side of steaks and freeze them up then just pop them in the oven during the week. 
From a food safety perspective, I'm not sure whether searing 1 side and then re-freezing would raise any concerns, since the steak would be partially cooked and partially raw/frozen.
(I tried posting a comment on the original article but comments are closed there hence I'm asking here).

Why are olives always better at the restaurant?,"Between olives I've been served at restaurants as a starter and various brands of olives I bought in supermarkets I have found that the ones in restaurants often taste much better. In particular they are often less salty, less bitter and more buttery in taste. 
Is this a bias on my part, maybe because I tend to be more hungry when I go to a restaurant or are they actually better. Are there particular varieties of olives  (eg. specific region or method of preservation or preparation) that taste like the ones in restaurants? Is it that they are fresher at a restaurant?
EDIT: I'm referring to plain olives here, not a processed. The kind you get as a starter, sometimes with some bread on the side. In particular mediterranean or middle eastern restaurants serve them that way.

Why avoid olive oil in Gotham Steel pans?,"Background
Gotham Steel is a ceramic coated titanium pan.  It's the brand with the commercials where they put a mixer in the pan, supposedly to show that it doesn't scratch if you use metal utensils.  The coating makes the pan non-stick, slippery even.  
It comes with the following instructions:  

FOR BEST PERFORMANCE
Gotham Steel™ Ti-Cerama™ Cookware with Titanium Ceramic Coating is designed for cooking without oil or butter.  If you choose to use oil or butter, always use it at the proper heat setting.  For example, extra virgin olive oil and butter should only be used over low heat.  NEVER USE NON STICK SPRAYS.  No sharp objects of any type should be used on the inside or outside of Ti-Cerama™ cookware.  

(Emphasis in original.)
I take the last sentence to mean that the mixer ad is exaggerated, but that's not my question.  
Olive Oil and coated pans
It says to only use extra virgin olive oil with ""low"" heat.  Since that's not exactly precise, I searched around for more information.  Some reviews said that Le Creuset (which makes a similar, enamel coated iron pan) says not to use olive oil at all.  So some people that had both recommended the same thing for the Gotham Steel pans.  No olive oil at all.  
I found this question and this question that suggest that the issue might be extra virgin olive oil's low smoke point.  I.e. that the olive oil might simply be susceptible to burning.  Not sure why the coating would make that worse, but it's a hypothesis.  
What actually happens when using olive oil on these kinds of pans?  Preferably Gotham Steel, but I'd take information on Le Creuset or similar brands of enamel/ceramic coated cookware.  What's ""low"" heat in this context?  
Example
I sometimes cook sandwich eggs in a Teflon pan with a little olive oil.  This basically involves turning the Kenmore stove to 7, letting the oil heat as I scramble an egg in a cup.  I turn the head down to 4 and pour the egg into the pan.  I wait until the egg is almost cooked through and then flip it.  I turn off the heat and wait a bit longer, then I eat it in a sandwich.  My experience is that if I do it right, the egg is fully cooked without fry marks.  
The stovetop is a Kenmore electric with the flat glass on top.  Non-induction, a regular heating element.  The heat goes Lo-2-3-4-Med-6-7-8-Hi.  The obvious thing would be for ""low"" heat to be Lo on the stovetop.  However, that's not a heat that I would normally use for anything other than simmering for a long period of time.  E.g. making rice.  Does 4 count as ""low"" heat since I don't keep it there long?  
Anyway, if I did that same process with the Gotham Steel pan, what would happen?  Would it ruin the pan?  Burn the egg?  Burn the oil?  
Note that if I don't use the oil, it cooks the egg fine and it slides right out of the pan.  That's satisfactory, but I would prefer to understand why I should or should not use olive oil.  
Ideally someone would have a scientific answer with testing using a Gotham Steel pan.  However, I would take an anecdotal answer involving a Le Creuset or other brand if it was explanatory.  E.g. I tried that with a ____ and boy did it ruin the pan by ...
Other oils
What happens with other greases and oils?  For example, we tried cooking a meatloaf in the dutch oven sized pan.  The ceramic container that we normally use is getting old and could be bigger.  So we were curious if this would work.  We normally use a fatty ground beef and pour off the grease before eating.  This leaves the bottom rather soft.  However, with this pan, the result was that the bottom charred into a black crunchiness.  Is this related to the problem with olive oil?  Or something entirely different and worthy of its own question?  Same thing with the passage about non stick sprays.  
The instructions say that the oven is safe to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.  We cooked at 350.  That's about 175-180 in metric/Celsius.  
We also tried a couple roasts in water with sliced onions underneath and they baked fine.  And we tried a casserole that has lentils, rice, and Swiss cheese.  That's rather greasy, but it didn't have the same behavior as the meatloaf.  I.e. the edges touching the pan didn't scorch or char.  
How do I know which oils will be problematic and which won't?

Here's the recipe:

3 cups flour, 2 1/2 cups sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 1/3 cups vegetable oil, 1 1/2 cups buttermilk, 3 eggs, 1 1/2 cups freshly brewed hot coffee, 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
Slowly combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and cocoa powder.  Blend (on medium speed) in the oil and buttermilk.  On low, mix in the eggs, one at a time.  Add the hot coffee and vanilla and mix on low speed.

I did that and the shrimp is cooked, but some of the ingredients seem to have got stuck to the bottom of the pot and got burnt a little, so there is a slight burnt smell.

So is washing with salt water the right way to go or is there something better?

Why aren't my macarons as soft as professional ones?,"I recently bought some macarons made by professional bakeries. When I got home, I threw them into the freezer and, days later, I checked on them. When I took a bite, it was still nice and soft. The cold temperature seemed to have had no effect whatsoever on the product. It was as tasty and supple as if it had been left out at room temperature.
The macarons that I make don't do this though. When they come out of the freezer, they're just crunchy. If I leave them out to thaw at room temperature, then they do soften up, but the store-bought ones don't need to thaw at all. I'd like for mine to do this as well. How can I keep my macarons soft while they're also being frozen?

Is there a guide to traditional culinary knives by cuisine?,"I went to a nearby supermarket that caters to a Spanish South American and Brazilian/Portuguese clientele. In addition to their excellent onsite fishmonger and butcher, the cookware section had a broad array of culinary knives in patterns I had never seen before. I know about the various patterns of French and German knives, and about the wide array of Japanese knives and their various uses, and about the Chinese chef's cleaver, and about the Indian bonti (with and without coconut scrapers) and chakku and gandasa...

Baking cauliflower with potatoes,"I like to cook a very simple recipe for roasted potatoes: I peel and cut potatoes to cubes, mix them in a sauce of olive oil, garlic and sweet paprika and place in the oven for about an hour under aluminum foil. I then take out the aluminum foil and for about 10-15 for a crunchy texture.
Now, I want to add cauliflower to the dish. I plan to cut the cauliflower to small pieces and just mix them with the potatoes. I don't have much experience with cauliflower - will I get thoroughly cooked and crunchy cauliflower? Do I need to pre-boil the cauliflower?

What is the correct reference for amount of salt in lacto-fermenting?,"When lacto-fermenting pickles, sauerkraut, kimchi, etc. do you do your salt calculations per amount of brine, or salt per volume of the pickling container?
I mean, if I use 1-3 tablespoons of pickling salt per quart, as I've seen recommended, a number of times, is that supposed to be per quart of pure brine or per quart jar of pickles? The answer could make a big difference in the result.
I've heard you should mix the brine separately and then pour it in. So, perhaps that means to make an entire quart of brine with 1-3 tablespoons of salt in that quart (even if you don't use all the brine when you pour it on your vegetables), rather than ensuring that 1-3 full tablespoons of salt are in the jar of pickles.
It seems like my pickles could use less salt, on average, despite warm temperatures, and I see other questions on here that might benefit from the answer here. So, I'm curious.
Again, is the salt relative to how much brine you have, or to the size of your container?

Difference between soup and stew,"What are the technical differences between a soup and a stew.
Specifically, I've always had some confusion on the differentation of stew and soup. For the most part, you can tell the difference by visual cues but sometimes some soup or stew looks ambigously in between and i can't tell the difference.  For example, wikipedia shows a picture of this as soup:

Yet it looks more like a stew to me. And then it shows this as a stew:

Yet that looks like a soup to me. So my main question is: What are the technical differences that determine whether it is a soup or a stew.

Is it valid to claim that a jam contains no preservatives?,"Some commercial jams state on the label that they contain ""no preservatives"", or are ""preservative free"". As I understand it, jam is a type of fruit preserve. Like most fruit preserves, it is protected against bacteria and mould before opening by the canning effect, and protected to a lesser extent against bacteria once opened, by its high sugar content (typically > 50% by weight).
Jams that I have seen labelled in this way also usually list citric acid as an ingredient, which commonly used as a food preservative.
My assumption is that food companies can get away with this labeling because sugar is required to activate the pectin during manufacturing, and citric acid can be said to be required for flavouring purposes.
My argument is that although jam wouldn't be jam without the gelling effect of the activated pectin, it also wouldn't be jam if it wasn't self-preserved after opening. It seems wrong to claim that sugar is not a preservative when used in jam, just because it has another function. It would be like claiming that full-cream milk is ""fat-free"" because the fat it does contain is required to make it appear white instead of having a blue tinge.
If another edible chemical that could activate pectin (but didn't have a preserving effect) was used to make jam, then would a manufacturer not get away with labeling the jam as having no preservatives, if sugar was added solely for the purpose of preservation?
I have not mentioned taste as a another function of sugar in jam because I don't think it is a relevant fact to consider. Jam tastes sweet because it is made with sugar for the reasons stated above, not because sugar is added to make it taste like jam.
Is ""no preservatives"" in jam a legitimate claim, or a marketing trick?
I have not researched the types of preservatives that are added to commercial jams that do not display the ""no preservatives"" claim, but I would be interested in this information if anybody knows.

Fermented onions in orange juice took a long time to show activity - are they safe to eat?,"I'm trying to ferment sliced red onions in orange juice with 6% salt. I used one tablespoon kimchi juice to start it.
It was started Monday last week, but until yesterday (after a week), there weren't any signs of fermentation occurring, not even bad smells or mold or anything, but then, yesterday at last I began seeing some small bubbles and today it's going really wild with the bubbling. 
It's been a week and I'm afraid it has some bad bacteria producing the bubbles, because of the long time that has passed.
I'm using an airtight jar which I've burped once everyday since the first day, and also mixed the contents everyday to avoid anything being on top for too long.
Is it safe to eat the fermented onions, or should I toss them?

While I know cold weather would slow down the fermentation process, I don't believe that's the case, since where I live, it's been around 68F-75F for the last week.

Possible dangers of home fermentation of vegetables,"I bought this FARMcurious Fermentation kit on Kickstarter. Once I got it and started making it I found their claims of it being ""super easy"" were a little exaggerated. When looking around online I found that other people recommended weighing your salt instead of measuring by volume and that it absolutely did matter what kind of salt you used (so I rinsed the veggies off and started over).
I started them fermenting in August and was supposed to check them in October. Well, it's now January and I've just been too afraid to try them.
There is no mold growing, they've been in a dark room in my basement. The airlocks are all intact. Nothing ""looks gross"". I opened up one that had cucumbers, carrots, and celery in it and it just smelled vaguely ""pickly"" (not bad at all). I tasted one and it was just sort of soft-ish and very salty. It's been 2 hours and I'm not dead or sick or anything.
My question is... What are the dangers here? How would I ""know"" if it ""didn't work"" or if it ""went bad""? This person tested PH and looked at it under a microscope. What would I look for exactly (I happen to have the exact same microscope)? What would happen if they were bad and how long would it take to happen (if I ate some)?
Most stuff I've seen online claims that if it were dangerous it would smell so bad you couldn't even eat it and that this is the absolute most safest method of preservation.

Need Help Identifying Characteristics of Vinegar in a Carolina BBQ Sauce,"A year ago I made my first Carolina-style BBQ sauce (specifically a Piedmont-style sauce). It was perfect, exactly what I was looking for in every way. I've never been able to replicate it.
The first batch was made with whatever red-cider vinegar we had in the cupboard; I didn't take notice of the brand, but I believe it was a supermarket generic brand, possibly either Giant or Harris-Teeter. The second batch I made was very, very harsh, and through trial and error I determined that it was the brand of vinegar that I used (Heinz red cider vinegar). The next batch was made with red wine vinegar and it was much better, but still not as good as the first batch (I still have a tiny bit of the first batch left). My latest batch is even better still, using the Giant-brand red cider vinegar -- but it's still not as good as that first batch.
I don't have words for why the first batch is better, other than ""less harsh"". Logically I know that vinegars can vary tremendously, and if I use a store brand, that will likely vary even more from batch to batch than a name brand; how can I make something that consistently excels if I can't define what I'm looking for?
My husband jokingly told me to find someone with a mass spectrometer, but I'm seriously considering it. Is there a better way? How do I go about figuring out what is different about that first batch? My supply is rapidly dwindling, just a few tablespoons, now.

Cooking sirloin steaks with Anova sous vide gave me leather tough steaks,"I'm new to the Anova sous vide machine and have successfully cooked tenderloin steaks beautifully with the device.

Seasoned before I seared and sat down to enjoy my tender juicy steak and it was like eating a piece of leather. As in it was totally uneatable. The temperature was spot on but the chewiness was horrible.

Emulating Starbucks Frappuccino Cream Base,"At Starbucks, the ""Cream Based"" (no coffee) frappuccinos all use a proprietary syrup base which I would like to emulate to be able to make a reasonable facsimile at home.
When the baristas make a ""Vanilla Bean"" frappuccino, the process goes something like this:

Add a measure of whole milk.
Add an appropriate measure of ice.
Add 3 pumps of aforementioned cream base syrup.
Add a few scoops of vanilla flavored powder.
Blend.

The milk/ice ratio I can play with, I've found a replacement for the vanilla powder that works well, but I'm stumped at re-creating the cream flavored syrup, which unfortunately, is absolutely key to getting the right taste and consistency.
I see some folks selling jugs of the stuff on ebay, which I can only assume is pilfered stock because Starbucks does not sell it retail. Fortunately, there are pictures of the ingredients label on the jug, which gives me a good starting point.
The image of the base is below.
The ingredients are listed as:

Water
Sugar
Salt
Natural and Artificial Flavor
Xanthan Gum (E415)
Potassium Sorbate (E202)
Citric Acid (E330)

It is a small fish that is salted, cooked in water, and then reheated periodically to preserve it.
My question is: Should the initial salting be done before the fish is cooked for the first time, or afterwards?
My worry is that the salt will be washed off or leached out during cooking, and the preservative effects will be lost. On the other hand, I have never heard of preserving a fish or meat after it has been cooked.

"Do pan ""pores"" exist, what are they, and what are their effects?","There are a number of common cooking lore techniques which revolve around the idea of ""pores"" in the surface of a pan.  Two of the ones I've heard most often:
(1) When heating a pan where sticking is a concern, one should wait until the pan is hot before adding oil/fat.  Supposedly the ""pores"" will close as the pan heats, leaving a flatter surface for the oil and less places where the food can get caught.  This is often cited for cooking on stainless steel, but sometimes for other materials as well.  (Some of the answers to this question, for example, cite this as a rationale for preheating pans before adding oil.)
(2) When seasoning cast iron (and sometimes other metals), one should be sure to heat the pan before applying oil.  Supposedly, the ""pores"" open up as the pan heats, allowing the oil/fat to penetrate the surface better and create a better seasoning.  (This has been mentioned a number of times here too, and it also is referenced on the Wikipedia page on seasoning pans, where preheating will ""open the 'pores' of the pan."")
One obvious problem here is the contradictory logic of these claims: in the first case, one heats the pan to ""close"" the ""pores,"" but in the second case, one heats the pan to ""open"" the ""pores.""  Which one is it?
I've heard these claims about ""pores"" and their very existence disputed.  At best, many commentators who seem to know something about properties of metals will say this is a strange shorthand term for the uneven surface of pans at the microscopic level.  (The end of this post and the discussion in comments, for example, contains some speculation along those lines.)
For years, I dismissed a lot of this discussion of ""pores"" as some sort of weird cooking lore myth.  For example, it's good to heat cast iron before seasoning to ensure it's thoroughly dry, regardless of the status of the ""pores"" in the metal.  And some people have done experiments claiming it doesn't matter whether you preheat a pan before adding oil to avoid sticking.
But I recently came upon a reference to these ""pores"" in Shirley Corriher's Cookwise, where she refers to the first claim I listed above: heating a pan to ""close the pores"" before adding oil/fat.  Alton Brown cites Corriher's claim too in a couple places, including in his Gear for Your Kitchen, where he refers to it as something you had to worry about to stop food from sticking in those ancient times before Teflon existed.  Corriher and Brown have been known to be wrong occasionally, but they generally are careful before citing random cooking lore.
So, are these ""pores"" real?  Do they expand or contract when heated?  Are their supposed culinary effects real?  Or is there some other mechanism or surface feature of metals that is being referenced here?
EDIT: Just to be clear, I'm hoping someone may be able to point to a more reliable discussion of what's going on from a reputable food science (or science in general) source. I have my own thoughts about what may be going on here based on my knowledge of thermodynamics, metallurgical crystalline structures, and general materials science. But in cursory searches, I haven't been able to find any solid discussions of these supposed ""pores"" based on actual scientific evidence.

Any tips on how to cook gruel?,"I like to cook rice gruel every now and then; however I usually encounter a basic problem.
First off, my rough procedure:

Mix (sticky) rice flour and water homogeneously
Pour into cooking pot (possibly hot, doesn't seem to make much of a difference)
Stir thouroughly during cooking, try not to go too high with the temperature so nothing burns.

What I have observed:
At a certain rice-water ratio, i.e. if I favor rice strong enough in the mixture, my gruel will very quickly turn into a blob of quite viscous mass, that has the undesirable property of not cooking evenly, so that I'm left raw patches of dough.  
I have tried stirring the blob for a long time, but I'm not even sure of whether to use higher heat levels or lower ones; the predicament seems to be

Too much heat leads to burning (if not the blob, then the layer sticking to the bottom; too much burning there and everything tastes burnt)
Too little heat: Not enough heat dissipates into the inner parts of the blob.

I'm not yet sure how to avoid this in the best way; does anybody have a good general procedure?

Questions about battering and frying chicken,"I like to fry up chicken occasionally and I've used a few different methods over the years.  Typically my recipe is something like:

Place milk or egg in one dish
Place a flour mixture in another
Drag chicken through liquid, then through flour, then fry up.

It usually turns out pretty well, but I was hoping to get some clarification on what some variations on this recipe do - so:
Some recipes call for dipping the chicken in egg before coating with flour while others call for milk (or butter milk).  

What is the difference between these two?  
Can I mix the two together and use that - if so, how would it be different than using just one?
Does it matter if I soak in the liquid for hours or do i just need to get it wet so the flour will stick?

I've seen some recipes that call for dipping in egg and flour twice.  I'm assuming this just makes the skin crustier?  

If I want an even thicker crust could I go even more than twice or will the batter just start falling off while frying if there is too much on there?

It can be sort of a time consuming process and I've wondered about doing some of the prep work the night before I cook.  

Is it possible to egg wash and dredge in flour and then store overnight?
If so, does this affect how the chicken fries up?  
If so, what is the proper technique?  I'm concerned that if I had a bunch of battered chicken breasts that were stacked on top of each other the batter might peel off when I tried to separate them the next day.

I realize that I could probably figure this out through trial and error, but was hoping to figure it out without wasting any food.  Thanks for any help!

Home made Rice Milk that's not slimy or chalky?,"I'm wondering if it's possible to make rice milk at home that's similar in texture/taste to Rice Dream rice milk.  Most recipes online are really similar to each other, essentially being, blend some rice with some water, and (either after straining or not, and sweetening or not) enjoy.  The two major differences seem to be with the rice being cooked before blending, or raw and soaked overnight before blending.
Having tried both now, here's what I feel:
- Cooked rice seems to leave the Rice Milk with a viscous/slimy texture
- Soaked raw rice seems to leave the Rice Milk with a chalky/powdery texture
Both of these, even after straining multiple times through a nut milk bag.  The second option seems slightly better to me, just because the slimy texture makes me want to gag, but using cooked rice seems like the more popular option online, so maybe I'm missing something.  I noticed none of the recipes call for salt or oil, both of which are listed ingredients in Rice Dream.  I'm not sure if that would make a difference for the texture.
Does anyone out there have any experience making Rice Milk and know how to make a decent tasting (or at least, decent-textured) batch at home?

Is this the way to make good pies?,"I'm working in a small bakery shop and my boss is new to the business and have no passion in baking at all. He only learned it from his dad few years ago and his dad learned from other people too. 
I love baking but was told not to try anything different than what he's told me to do. 
At the moment, the pies I make, the flaky crust on top keep lifting up after baked and don't know why. 
Here is how i make the bottom crust pastry: 

7kg of all purpose flour
3.5kg of butter (forgot the brand name and the butter is ok to leave outside at room temperature)
2.1L of water
Mix it for about 7 mins roughly until it combine together and sometimes it's quite stretchy after 7mins of mixing (is this normal?)

Here is how i make the top flaky crust pastry

6kg of all purpose flour
1.5kg of pastry gems 
3L of water
Once it's all well mixed, add 2.2kg of pastry gem on top and mix it for 1 mins just to roughly combine.

So normally I would just mold all the bottom crust into the pie trays and leave it at room temperature then add the filling then cover it with flaky top pastry that usually keep in the fridge for about 1 or 2 hours. I also notice that the top pastry need to be refrigerated for at least 2 or 3 hours before use, otherwise it is hard to cover the pie tray. 
After I cover all the pies with flaky pastry top, brush with eggs then usually my boss leaving the tray at room temperature for about 10mins as he would turn the oven on after I have made all the pies. 
My question is, are these the right way to make good crust pies and why is the top flaky crust keep lifting up after baked?

Why cooking times for rice are different in different locations,"When I learned to cook rice in the New Orleans area, I used the following recipe:
In a big sauce pan measure 1 cup long grain rice to two cups room temperature water, salt to taste.
Bring to a boil, turn heat down to simmer, cover with lid for 30 minutes and rice is done. Never use a spoon in rice, only a fork. This is the way I was taught and it worked perfectly every time.
I moved to Indiana and tried the same method, same rice brand, same water, approximately the same type of stove. Now I have to use more water and less cook time, about 20 minutes total, instead of 30. 
I know that Indiana is more than 700 feet above sea level, and parts of New Orleans are actually below sea level. But from what I have read, you ought  to add to cook time when at a higher altitude, not subtract. 
What causes this difference? Is it really due to altitude? Perhaps relative humidity? New Orleans has a very humid climate, Indiana is usually much drier. Today for example, I checked and Indianapolis has 39% relative humidity, and New Orleans – 90%. 
Has anyone else heard of such a difference in cooking times? I would like to see if there is any kind of table giving cooking times based on local climatic differences. Please confine answers/comments to either experience or research.

Do I need to use guar gum in conjunction with Xantham Gum to not have the ice cream freeze like a rock?

How to store crumble cake,"I've just made a rather delicious raspberry ""crumble cake"". It consists of a thin layer of cake with whole raspberries, topped with crumble and baked. I get the impression crumble is more of a British thing, so for those that haven't come across it, crumble is basically a rich, buttery, sugary crumb topping that goes nicely crunchy when baked (flour, sugar and lots of butter).
After eating as much as we could today, there's still quite a bit left. I'm now wondering how I can store it so that:

It maintains the textures as well as possible (cake stays moist and crumble  stays crunchy)
I don't give anyone a bad stomach

I've always been told you should store cakes at room temperature as putting them in the fridge ruins the texture and generally isn't necessary if they're eaten within a few days. Would the same apply to my crumble cake?
Also, will storing it in a closed container cause the crumble to go soggy due to absorbing moisture from the cake? I've stored some scones overnight in a tub before and by the morning their crunchy outside had gone all chewy.
Any thought appreciated.

Does meat need to be washed before preparation?,"I don't even remember where I have learned that, but I've always thought it common knowledge: Before a piece of meat gets seasoned, or malleted for tenderizing (sorry, don't know the English word for that), or marinated, or thrown into the pan, or ground, it should be first washed under the faucet, and then patted dry. When I think of it, it also makes sense to me, because the bacteria are always on the meat surface, never inside. So I don't think it is a vestige of the time one got bloodied cuts from the village butcher, but that it applies to the modern meat pieces sold on absorbent pads too. 
And then I read this question, which presumes patting (but doesn't mention washing). Most of the answers and comments seem to indicate that patting isn't always considered necessary, and there is no mention of washing the meat or of the dripping water from the washing. In fact, the answers and comments wouldn't make much sense if one assumes that the meat has been just washed. 
So is washing compulsory, is it optional but a good idea, is it plain useless, or does it even have disadvantages for the meat?

My seitan is horrible,"I have no trouble preparing the seitan dough, or at least, that is what troubles me the least and can be fixed easily. However, I can't get the texture right. I don't use yeast, just vital wheat gluten and flavor adders.
First I tried with the simmering method. I put a broth to a boil and dropped in small loafs of seitan. As they cooked, they grew bigger and bigger, as they absorbed water. The loafs grew a ridiculous amount, and I was consequently left with loafs made of water and seitan, in that order.
I thought maybe water was the problem, so I tried instead of simmering it, baking it; like some online recipes indicate. I made a seitan tube and wrapped it (rather mediocrely) in aluminium foil and put in the oven. I had preheated the oven to 190 °C. The recipe I used instructed to bake the seitan for 90 minutes, and so I tried. However, about 60 minutes into the cooking, my loaf exploded in the oven (the wrap wasn't strong enough, I recon, although it was a few layers thick). To my surprise, the seitan already had a thick hard crust, and it was quite inedible to my taste.
What recommendations do you have for me? Is there something I have done wrong in each of my attempts? (Is blaming the great growth of my seitan on water wrong, on the first method I tried?) And finally, I am left to wonder: is it really necessary to precook seitan? (Why?)

Oven temp for dishes with different nominal cooking times?,"I want to cook two dishes simultaneously (for efficiency's sake): carrots, which have a nominal cooking temp of 350 F / 180 C for 30 mins. and chicken, which has a nominal cooking temp of 400 F / 200 C for 45 mins. The Seasoned Advice posts I've read on this subject (here, here, here, and here) suggest the thing to do is cook at the lower temp first, then turn the oven to the higher temp; I can do that if necessary, but if possible I'd prefer to have everything in the oven at once, since the second dish cooks for a while.
If I put the carrots in at 400, how much should I reduce the cooking time? And how severely will it affect the result?

Scoring medium hydration dough after it's been in the oven,"I've been using this setup for 60% hydration dough: 
20 mins in cloche, covered, 500°
10 mins in cloche, covered, 450°
20+ mins uncovered, 450°
For all intents and purposes, the cloche works like a Dutch oven, trapping moisture:


(You can see in my second photo my rescue attempt)
I've got a baking sheet with water to maintain humidity in the oven as I bake it. 
The problem I'm running into is that when I score the bread (1/4"" - 1/2"", single cut along the centre, trying my best for a 45° angle, immediately before it goes in the oven), the score actually glazes over, becoming part of the crust, and preventing the score from doing it's job of 'ventilation'. The first time this happened, my dough blew out. The next two times, I've caught it happening in the first 5 mins and re-scored it after it's been in the oven. 
So, two questions:

Is scoring bread after it's baked for a few minutes a common thing? Do bakers do this?
If not, what can I do to my baking method to prevent the score from crusting over?

What is a cheap and useful way to reheat fried/grilled fish?,"I almost never like reheating leftover fish. Especially if it's fried. Whenever I have fish, I use simple seasonings because I really like how tilapia and milkfish tastes, but after I put it in the oven, it comes out with a terrible texture.
I'm quite dissatisfied if I put it in a regular oven and bake it. The skin and flesh have some kind of osmosis where the moisture that I wanted in the flesh seeps out to the skin, leaving the flesh drier and the skin rubbery. There's also an off-flavor that develops even if I reheat it the next day.
I tried microwaving before. It's worse.
With fish of this type, what should I do to avoid these problems?

Impact of different sugar types (and substitutes) on ice cream,"I am really interested in theoretical fundamentals of ice cream making. Everyone who is a little sophisticated whith homemade ice cream knows, that the are certain ingredients and ratios that have to be satisfied to make good ice cream. 
In fact understanding the theoretics of ice cream making and knowing how to calculate the ratios of ingredients helped me getting my ice cream perfect every time. 
A big influence on texture and storability (in terms of hardness when storing the ice cream in the freezer) has sugar.
Sucrose is the most common used sugar, but other types used are lactose (from milk products), dried glucose syrup, dextrose and inverted sugar syrup 
They all have influence on the freezing point of the mixture. The lower the freezing point of the ice cream mass, the softer it is when it comes out of the freezer. The sugars also differ in sweetness, which is measured relative to sucrose (1.0). Lactose (0.3), Dried Glucose Syrup (0.5), Dextrose (0,75), Inverted sugar syrup (1.25)
For this reasons a part of the sucrose is often substituted by dextrose, since you can use more of it (to have the same sweetness) and increase dry mass and lower the freezing point.
My chemistry skills are nearly non existent, so my question is how can I quantify the influence of different sugar types on the freezing point of my mixture? I want to determine how much Xylitol I must use to get the same results (in terms of freezing point) as when I used sucrose. To get to the meta level: How can those figures be calculated (I guess it involves molar masses, oh boy!)
Some figures for the sugars above and also Xylitol and Erythritol would be appreciated. 
Criteria for an accepted answer:

Must name a measure for influence of sugar on freenzing point on a mixture
Must give figures for all mentioned sugar (alcohol) types.
Nice to have: A way to calculate the figures
Can use basic math and chemisty

"Pizza dough didn't rise, maybe yeast cells were killed off","I made a pizza dough and I left it to rise until doubled in bulk. However, it didn't rise at all. After reading here I can just guess that I killed the yeast cells:

Yeast Is Too Hot. Recipes that call for active dry yeast direct you to dissolve that yeast in warm water. Sometimes the recipe calls for the liquid to be heated with fat and then added to the yeast. Either way, if the liquid is too hot it will kill off yeast cells. Yeast is pretty picky. It doesn’t like it too cold and it doesn’t like it too hot.

If this is the case and after waiting more time, it still doesn't rise, is there something I can do with the dough? I wouldn't want to throw it away.

How to stir fry frozen veggies?,"There are various frozen veggie mixes available in my local grocery shops, that are meant to be used in stir fries (according to their description at least), but I can't seem to get satisfactory result out of them. Whenever I try to stir fry them, two things happen:

Wok's temperature drops due to the ice-cold veggies being put inside.
As veggies defrost while I cook them, they release a lot of extra water.

And I get mushy veggies as a result. As if I were making a stew or something.
So is there a trick to it? Should I defrost everything and drain the liquid before frying? Instruction on the bag says, that I should put veggies on the pan in frozen state. Any idea why?
Or maybe it is the quality of product that matters?

Note that when I was adding in the aubergines, I was not paying close attention to the original recipe's quantities.  
After cooking it, I gave the dish a taste test, and the flavor is rather bland. I think the problem may be having too low a ration of spices to aubergines.

Rice cooker not stopping?,"I bought a first rice/multicooker Tefal RK8121. I cooked the rice according to the manual.
I put the rice inside and added the steaming tray on top of the rice to steam at the same time (it doesn't say anything about that in the manual though). Added the water and started the program (with pre-washed rice). The program is one that automatically stops using some sensors inside the machine.
The rice is supposed to be cooking for 10 minutes, as written on the package. It didn't stop cooking, so after 40 minutes I had to stop it. The bottom of the rice was already a bit overcooked and the rice was mushy due to it being so long in there.
Why did it not stop? I tried it another time with wild rice, and it stopped itself after 30 minutes and the rice was perfect. But with white rice like Thai Jasmin, it didn't stop even after 40 minutes, this happened twice. I know somebody else who bought the same cooker and has the same problem, I guess there's something we must be doing wrong, but I'm not sure what.

Why is there no pork on the Indian take-away menu?,"The standard Indian takeout menu does not represent the kind of food eaten in India. India is a large country and ""Real Indian food"" is little more meaningful than ""Real European food"". Dishes commonly eaten in the North might be foreign to people living in the South and vice-versa. Takeout favourites (tikka masala, madras, rogan josh) don't exist in India in that form. Those dishes are European inventions inspired by Indian dishes. 
When I open an Indian take-away menu I see chicken, beef, lamb, seafood and vegetarian dishes. But there is no pork. India is a predominately vegetarian country. When the modern take-out menu was invented, common European meats were added to the menu. Except for pork. How come?
The Chinese takeaway is a similar story. You will find chicken, beef, pork, seafood and vegetarian dishes that don't resemble anything eaten in China. Now we have pork but no lamb. I suspect that is because lamb is expensive in Europe. But it goes to show pork dishes sell. So why not pork Indian dishes? 
Edit: Comments mention that Goan cuisine features pork from Portuegese influence. This is interesting because some dishes, for example Vindaloo, are an Indian take on a European dish, rather than for example Tikka Masala which is a European take on an Indian dish. However the question is only about the extent to which pork is eaten in India, insofar as it influences why pork never made its way onto Indian takeout menus in Europe.

Help with sweet scotch bonnet sauce,"I'm looking to make a hot sauce that would be great for dipping and BBQing. I've made about 5 batches with different variations but generally the same idea. Some batches have been too hot, some too sweet, and some lacking depth. People have told me they like it, but I personally am not happy with it.
I have realized that I do not like the tastes of molasses or brown sugar and that it smells bad to me when cooking, so I am trying to perfect this recipe using only honey as a sweetener.
I wanted some feedback from the gurus here as to how I can balance the amount of heat, sweet, and acidity in this recipe. I like things pretty hot, and I also like pepper. I'd say on a scale of mild-medium-hot-suicide, I'm aiming for hot. As for pepper, a lot of the recipes I've read online don't even use pepper, but it is essential for me.

2 tbsp unsalted butter
1 chopped onion
1 chopped bell pepper
3 scotch bonnets, stems removed, keep whole
5 chopped garlic cloves
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup lime juice
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
1 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp peppercorn
2 sm cans tomato paste

Here is how I'm cooking it:
step 1:
melt butter over medium heat
add chopped onion, bell pepper, garlic cloves, and whole scotch bonnets
cook until tender (approx 10-15 mins)

step 2:
add honey, lime juice, vinegar, sea salt, peppercorn, and tomato paste
bring to a boil and low rolling boil for approx 10 mins
lower heat and simmer for approx 30 mins

step 3:
let cool to room temperature
blend until smooth

I'm just looking for some feedback as to how I can improve this recipe and balance it well. What is it lacking? What proportions are off? Should I add ginger? Do I need more garlic? What better steps can I take during the cooking process?

Safety Question about making stainless steel flat-top,"I work in the office of a metal fabrication shop. I have access to cheap(comparatively) metal and a means of getting pretty much exactly what I want.
I've recently been watching youtube.com videos and making some of the really thin ""smash"" burgers. The problem is that even with my biggest pan on the stove top, I can only put in about 2, maybe 3, and it's hard to get a spatula in to flip, much less where some of the videos recommend scrapping with force to help keep the crispy crust you just formed. I'm specifically thinking about some of 'Balistic BBQ' channel's videos. 
This guy uses a bunch of different cooking surface styles. I think he is a rep for some of these grill companies or gets paid to promote the products, but does it in a cool way by making different food items, mostly burgers, and doing them on these various cook tops. He's got a cool one that is a grill on one half, a griddle on a quarter, and a mini deep fryer on the other quarter. 
I just think it's a really good idea to have something like that outside where you don't have to worry about a mess or spilling. You can also get all around it and do whatever you want to the food. I think he even had his own SS cooking surface made and may sell them, but I can make mine cheaper.
My question is about quality and safety. What grade and thickness of material would be best? I can pretty easily get SS-304-.25 material. I thought that would be a good thickness. My plan, as it stands now, is to get a rectangle cut to go on my gas grill. I can easily adjust the burners and I'd sit it on top of the cast iron grates. I'd have a back and sloping sides made and welded on to provide carrying handles as well as something to push against if food slides while flipping.
I also realize before anyone mentions it that I have perfectly good cast iron grates to cook a burger on. However, some of the burgers and techniques need a flat surface with no holes for anything to fall down through. You need it for ""smash"" burgers, throwing chopped onions on to caramelize, doing the metal bowl dome to steam or melt cheese, etc... It'd also be great for doing mass pancake cooking or anything else you'd use a flat top for. My mother has a small Teflon coated flat top for ""pan"" frying lots of pork chops, but the grease will splatter and make a mess. This would be perfect, assuming it does a good job of transferring the heat from burner to grates to surface.
So, does anyone know if this would be a good material or if there is any danger in using it. I don't think there is. I did a little research and found that 304 is the most widely used for cooking utensils. I also have access to 430, but that didn't look like it'd hold up as well. Hexavalent chromium isn't supposed to be an issue at cooking temps. I think it has to get up to 2500deg and become liquid before it's toxic. From what I read anyway. So any help would be appreciated. I'm sure it'll be fine to make this, but I wanted a second or tenth opinion. Also, do you guys think this is a good thickness or would I do as well with a thinner guage. Thanks.

I can get maybe 99% of the air out, but technically the bag is not under vacuum. If I clip the top of the bag to the side of my container, any air pockets that emerge collects at the top, and the meat is entirely in contact with the bag and immersion bath. Alternatively, if I seal the bag with a marinade, there are no pockets of air between the meat and the immersion bath. 
I can't imagine that the temperature transfer can be any more effective when vacuum sealed. So why does a site like SeriousEats still suggest that a vacuum sealer is needed for best results with longer cooking times?  
update from http://www.seriouseats.com/2016/08/how-to-seal-food-airtight-without-vacuum-sealer-water-displacement-method.html#comments-299859
In the context of food storage in plastic bags, SeriousEats claims, ""excess air causes oxidation that can develop into off flavors or promote spoilage."" But I never sous vide for the freezer, it gets served when done. 
There was a comment that asked if food contamination might occur for cooking times longer than 48 hours, but it was never answered. 
What is the science behind this statement? How much residual air is ""too much""? 
If the bag remains submerged, does not leak, and the food in full contact with the water bath, is that enough to duplicate the benefits of a true vacuum seal?
update 2
Also, what is the scientific impact of trapping small amounts of residual air in a pocket above the water bath?  This assumes that there is still a very strong thermal coupling between the water bath and sous vide item. 
In the photo below, you can see at least a 2inch gap between the air pockets above water level and the actual short ribs. From a heat transfer perspective, I can't imagine that a vacuum sealed bag can perform significantly better—certainly not relative to a 48hr cook time. Is there a possibility of bacterial contamination?

How do I make the panko bread stick to my egg-coated chicken?,"I am trying to do a pan-fried schnitzel with chicken breast coated in a mix of eggs, salt, pepper, some ketchup, a bit of olive-oil and sweet paprika.

In a small saucepan set over low heat, melt together baking chocolate, cocoa, coffee and coconut oil, whisking to combine. Set aside. 
Using a fork, mash banana with baking soda on a plate. In the bowl of a mixture, add banana mixture, eggs, Splenda, buttermilk, vanilla and the rest of the ingredients, except flour and chocolate mixture. Whisk thoroughly, using whisk attachment.  
Switch to mixing attachment. Bring chocolate mixture to a boil.  Add flour and boiling chocolate mixture. Mix again on medium speed, scraping down sides and bottom of the bowl, until batter is well mixed, a couple of minutes.   
Pour batter into prepared pan(s). Tap pans gently several times on the counter to remove air bubbles. Bake on middle rack 20 to 25 minutes or just until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 
When just out of the oven, remove the cake from the pan and place both cake and the parchment it was baked in, on a rack and then straight into the freezer for at least 30 minutes. After this time, wrap with plastic wrap, then foil, and place back into the freezer until ready to frost.

How to bake the Betty Crocker Super Moist White Cake,"Firstly - I have a Betty Crocker super moist white cake mix which is 16.25 oz. Would putting all of the 16.25 oz cake mix in a 9 x 1.5 inch wilton round pan not be a good idea? If it's not a good idea, what is your suggestion? The recipe says it could make two 9-inch rounds. But I'm afraid that the cake will come out thin. That's why I'm thinking of putting all the cake mix in one pan.
Secondly - The recipe calls for 1 1/4 cups water, 1/3 cup vegetable oil, and 3 egg whites. Can I substitute these to 1 1/4 cups milk, 1/3 melted butter, and 4 egg whites? Are these the right amount for substitutions?
Thirdly - I want to bake four layers. Can I mix 4 cake mixes all together at once? If yes, then would I multiply 4 times of the substitution amount?
Fourthly - I want to avoid having a dome so I'm planning to use baking strips (made out of foil and paper towels). Should I bake the cake at 325 using home convection ovens? The instruction calls for 350 for nonstick pan (not sure if its for convection or conventional oven). And how many minutes should I bake it for?

Why did my mozzarella turn out like ricotta?,"I bought my wife a mozzerella kit for christmas, and we tried to make it last night. We followed the directions pretty closely. I supposed we could have removed a bit more whey at some early steps. It also got up to 112F instead of the called for 105F before letting the curds form. But it never came together or reached the shiny smooth consistency that the directions called for. It would not hold together well enough to pull / stretch. It ended up like ricotta. It was good, but it wasn't what we were aiming for.
When doing my Christmas shopping, I noticed that some of the kits were for making mozzarella or ricotta, so I assume that the two have the same ingredients and a slightly different process. So what's the difference in process for the two? I'm thinking that's where we went wrong.

Will terrible things happen if I replace part or all of the refined sugar in this recipe with malt extract?,"Behold the recipe: https://www.howtocookthat.net/public_html/giant-mars-bar-recipe-milky-way-bar/
I'm planning to make a cake based on the Zero Candy Bar for father's day, because it's my dad's favorite and they aren't always available in stores around here.
The nougat in the Zero bar is slightly chocolatey, but has a much stronger malt flavor and is very chewy as well--especially compared to the nougat in a Milky Way bar, for example. So I've been trying to research different nougat recipes. I've found different chocolate malt nougat recipes using malted milk powder, but I don't have any of that. My mom's a home-brewer, so I have actual powdered Malt extract.
I might try the recipe as stated first--to see if it's good enough as is, but what might happen if I replace part or all of the white sugar with my malt extract? I know they're different chemically which means they might (will?) react differently to heat, but I can't find much information on malt extract being using to make candy at all. Does it have a hardball stage?

How would I jar a sauce for keeping at room temperature without adding loads of vinegar or sugar?,"I'd like to make and sell jars of my mum's satay sauce at our local food markets. 
I'm trying to figure out the jarring process so it can be stored at room temperature and not make anyone sick or worse.
My experience in jarring/canning is minimal but I've done some research and would love to get some of your thoughts on my process. 
I'm aware of botulism, so the ingredients of concern are fresh chillies, garlic, onions and belacan (salted shrimp paste).
These are fried with peanut oil.
There is sugar and vinegar in the mix. 
There is a good amount of sugar however it's definitely not 50% like jam or anything. 
The amount of vinegar is not a huge amount (should I ph test this? how and what ph would I look for?)
The rest is peanuts and dried spices. 
These are the steps I'm taking at the moment:

Sterilize jars and lids in preheated oven @ 140c for 20 mins.
Fry fresh ingredients at high temp.
Slow cook remaining in large pot at low temp.
Fill jars while sauce is hot.
Put filled jars in preheated oven @ 140 for 30 mins with lid loosely on.
Remove and tighten lid.

When cooled, the lids pops down and is sealed.
The jars are from a local supplier and have confirmed with them that they can be cooked.

Why is my stock flavorless?,"I made stock last Sunday, which I intended to use as the base for homemade tonkotsu (pork broth) ramen.  Accordingly, I used both chicken and pork (roughly equal amounts of chicken backs and pork hocks).  I also added several cloves of garlic, a large leek, celery, carrots, and small knob of ginger.  
I boiled the meat/bones briefly before straining and starting over with cold water (for clarity of finished stock), added the other ingredients, and brought to a boil.  I then reduced to a simmer and skimmed the very small amount of scum from the surface.  The stock simmered for about 8 hours before I strained it through a cloth.
The resulting stock is perfectly clear, with an excellent, thick mouthfeel and gelled nicely in the refrigerator.  However, the stock also has very little flavor-- even copious amounts of salt don't help much.  Since my stock is by all other measures a success, I'm puzzled as to why it's so flavorless.

"What is the real difference in lo mein, chow mein, mei fun, and chop suey?","Prompted by the question  How to cook Lo Mein?  and some of the answers regarding types of noodles, I started wondering what the real differences are in the 4 named dishes.

Edited to clarify: I'm just asking a basic question, not for ingredients, per se. For example - Dish ""X"" is stir-fried vegetables (with or without meat) in sauce served with soft rice noodles. 
I understand that much of the difference is in the type of noodles used and how they are prepared. However, I've always heard that much of the American-Chinese cuisine was loosely adapted and not really the same thing or possibly didn't originate in China. So, I'm just trying to find out what is authentic.

Rice Variety for Puerto Rican Rice?,"I recently visited Puerto Rico and was blown away by how consistently good the rice was at restaurants.  It appeared to be a medium grain rice very similar in consistency and texture to East Asian rices that have a certain degree of stickiness while maintaining its shape and grain integrity. Later, I was very surprised to learn that Puerto Rico imports nearly all of its rice, but that gave me hope that I might be able to find the same variety back home. I visited a supermarket while there, however, all of the rice I found was labeled ""Long Grain"" (despite appearing to be medium or even short grain).

How to get moist goo in layers of chelsea buns,"I'm trying to make chelsea buns like the ones from my home town as I no longer live there so can't get them very often. I've done quite a bit of experimenting and while I'm quite a way off,  I have created a bun I am very happy with except for one thing: a gooeyness in between the swirled up layers.
This is obviously something to do with the filling but I can't work out what. All Chelsea recipes use butter, brown sugar and fruit for the filling but the butter and sugar just disappear during cooking, leaving dry bread. In the chelseas from the bakery, there is a thin layer of brown stickiness in-between the rolled up layers. Not much, but enough to be making the buns moist and sweet on the inside.
Does anyone have any idea how to achieve this? It's as if the buns haven't fully cooked in between the layers, leaving a slightly sticky inside, a bit like undercooked dough. I can't figure out what is being put in the filling to achieve this. 
I'm trying to get hold of a picture of one of these buns to better illustrate what I mean and will upload as soon as I get it. 
Thanks. 
EDIT
I've now added the below pictures.
See how the chelsea bun from the bakery (top pic) is still moist in the layers between the rolls and the bread itself looks soft and bendy.
Contrast that with my bun and you can see the butter/sugar mixture I layered up in the middle has disappeared with cooking. It looks dried out. On top of that,
 the bun itself seems dry in comparison as you can see it has cracked upon unrolling whereas the bakery bun has not.
Does anyone have any ideas on how to achieve this moistness both in the dough and in between the layers??

So, is this the most caloric, edible ingredient? Or does anybody know of a more caloric one(2)?

(2) According to the calculations in SZCZERZO KŁY's answer and following a clue given by MSalters's comment, lard has a bit more calories (902 kcal) per 100 grams of product.

Does one have to occasionally put up with this kind of nasty surprise after switching to organic beans?,"First I diversified my source of protein by eating beans. Then I was glad to find that it's a lot easier to find organic beans than organic beef. Even better, I could stock on a variety of beans and reduce my visit to the health food store to once every six months.
Now the bad news. Before cooking beans, I submerge them in water overnight. I'm now finding that one kind of beans is infected with insects. These living insects float to the surface. This happened despite that I stored the beans in an airtight container. Given the airtight storage, I'm guessing that I purchased the beans already contaminated, possibly with eggs.

Is this one of the distasteful surprises that one must put up with once in a while if one chooses organic beans? I'm guessing that the very reason we humans are interested in organic food—the absence of pesticides—is also the reason why insects will get attracted to them. Although they may be present just as much in other non-organic food, except that they would have perished.
In the old days it was apparently not uncommon to buy apples from the store and once in a while find a worm. These days even organic apples never show these undesirable proteins, possibly as a result of food irradiation.

Why was fish cut open at supermarket?,"I bought some whole mackerel at the supermarket yesterday and I found when I opened the package that the fish had had their belly cut open but they had not been cleaned.

In fact two small worms had actually crawled out and were on the outside of the fish.

PH and sour / acid taste,"I had always thought low pH foods had a noticeable sour (acid) taste, and vice-versa.
But when reading The Bread Builders by Daniel Wing & Allan Scott, on page 54, it says:

The sour taste of especially sour naturally leavened bread comes more from the total amount of acid in the bread than from the pH of the bread.

After knowing that, someone I know made the following experiment:


Measured the pH of vinegar with a ph-meter.
Prepared a solution of Spirits of salt with the same pH.
Drink both.


Pure vinegar tastes much more acid than spirits of salt. In fact, the last one has almost no acid taste.
So, it seems my initial thoughts were wrong. Why? Also, what makes we perceive foods as acid tasting?

Update:
After some research (thanks to rumtscho's comment) I have found that taste buds detect the presence of H+ ions (as cited in the Wikipedia article on Gustatory system). 
But still don't know why when drinking Acetic Acid (vinegar) sourness is sensed more than when drinking HCl (Spirits of salt), if both of them are diluted to have the same pH.
Update 2:
After @Wayfaring Stranger's answer it is clair that sour taste is given by anions (and not H+ ions), as written in this question's last update.

Do induction cookers increase risk of cracking cast iron?,"I recently purchased a counter-top, one element 1800W induction cooker, mostly just to see how well the technology worked compared to my gas range.
I took it out of the box and immediately threw about a half inch of water in a cast-iron skillet as a test and set the coil to max power. I noticed that the water began boiling almost immediately (impressive) but in very tight hot spots (two very clear concentric rings, presumably the shape of the coils or some magical physics property of the magnetic fields), taking a long time to spread to other areas (as expected with cast iron).
In fact, the hot spots heated up so quickly that the water was almost completely boiled before the handle had even a hint of warmth, and areas as close as a half inch or so to the hot spots remained cool to the touch for some time after the hot spots were hot enough to boil water. 
My question is: Due to the rapid heating and large temperature differentials seen here, in practice does this lead to an increased incidence of cracking cast-iron with induction cookers? If so, what precautions should be taken (e.g. preheat cast-iron at a lower power first, only use cookware designed specifically for induction, etc.)?

How to create fruity or grassy shortbread cookies?,"I saw a recipe for green tea shortbread cookies with white ganache filling and fell in love with it. But here, it is quite hard to get any matcha, the few Amazon marketplace sellers have very high prices. 
Now I want to use this as an inspiration to create a new recipe. I want to have a shortbread cookie which has a light, summery flavor added to the dough. As I can't get matcha, I don't think I can do something else from the grassy corner, but a fruity taste would be good enough. 
The problem is that this recipe works because the matcha is a dry powder. I know of other recipes which include a dry powder, such as mandelkipferl, but I can't think of a fruity powder to use. And I am afraid that adding fruit-based ingredients will make the dough too liquid. My current best idea is to proceed like making raspberry leather, but after I have reduced the strained raspberry juice, to add it to the dough instead of letting it dry. I am not sure if it will work. 
My questions: 

Do you think the raspberry idea will work, and why (or why not)? 
If you think that raspberries will work, what is the best form of incorporating them? How to get the product as dry as possible without it hardening? 
How much raspberry juice/syrup can I add before it changes the dough too much? 
How should I change my dough working methods after the addition of raspberry juice/syrup? 
Can you think of any other method which will give me a fruity or grassy tasting cookie dough? 

My constraints: 

The taste should be incorporated in the dough itself. Not in the filling, and not be present as chunks in the dough (the way scones have raisins, etc.). 
The taste should be of summer fruit or herb(s). Not maple, almond, nutmeg, chocolate, etc. - I know these are easy to incorporate, but it is not what I want to do right now. 
The taste should come from the plant itself. I know I can get powder intended for flavoring water or milk, consisting of dextrose and synthetic aromas, but I don't want that. 
The taste should pair well with the white chocolate ganache. 
I don't insist on keeping the texture absolutely the same as a shortbread cookie. After all, I will be adding wet ingredients where there were none. But I still want it to be close enough to be recognized as a shortbread derivative, I don't want to create a baked pancake or a chewy cookie, or something else.

Why are poblanos sometimes called pasillas?,"Background information: poblano peppers are one of the most common peppers in Mexican food. Pasilla peppers are something entirely different - the dried form of the chilaca.
I'm originally from Texas, where poblanos are commonly found in grocery stores. I moved to California a while back, and here they're still pretty easy to find, but they're always labeled ""pasilla"". Even at a local produce market with a decent amount of Mexican food (and Spanish-speaking employees) - and just recently I noticed they even have anchos (dried poblanos) labeled as ""dried pasillas"". I did manage to find one local Mexican restaurant menu online describing a chile relleno as a stuffed poblano, but otherwise it seems pretty universal.
So where did this come from? Via the above-linked wikipedia article, I did find a website saying it's the fault of the California produce industry for labeling them this way, but that's not the original reason. Is it all just the result of a single person getting it wrong a long time ago, and an entire produce industry building off of that?

How can I make the tops of my macarons smooth?,"After a recent trip to France, I have become mildly obsessed with making macarons (using this recipe). I have made a couple of batches so far - the first didn't turn out well, more like cookies than macarons, due to under-whipped egg whites and too-coarse almonds.
The second batch has turned out better, much more like macarons. I whipped the egg whites to stiff, glossy peaks and blitzed the almonds, powdered sugar and cocoa in a food processor to remove lumps and make the almonds finer. Some of the macarons even have the characteristic little 'feet'.
However, while the flavour and texture seem generally good, they don't have the smooth, perfect surface of a proper macaron. Looking at videos online, it would seem my mixture is too stiff, because any little tip of mixture left by the piping bag fails to 'melt' into the main part of the macaron - it simply sits there. Also, any little craters left by air holes in the mixture fail to smooth themselves out, so the result is a bumpy macaron.
Given that the egg whites need to be stiff and glossy, what else could be a factor in achieving a smooth macaron? I assume the amount of powdered sugar is a factor, but how much can I safely reduce the amount by?

How to fix grass finished beef that tastes like fish?,"I bought a 1/4 grass finished cow (I had a good experience with a 1/2 pig from the same seller, so didnt feel the need to start small).
We cooked some ground beef, and it was fine. But the second cut we tried were the NY strips and the fat on them tasted strongly of fish. I prepared the steak as i would any other store bought steak. I salted then fried in a cast iron pan on high with a little oil, removing the steaks from the pan at 125F. This normally produces steaks I enjoy a lot.
Based on a little research, it is common for grass finished beef to have some odd flavors if you are used to grain finished beef (almost all beef is raised on grass, the difference is what they are fed in the end to fatten up).
So, if all my steaks did taste fishy, is there a preparation method to mitigate the fishyness?
I'm am familiar with gamey flavors of meat, having eaten quite a lot of moose, caribou, rabbit, and the parts of a cow most people don't seem interested in. This fishy flavor was not like those.

How do I convey an order for over medium eggs without runny yolks?,"I'm not a chef; I'm a (new) waitress and a few days ago a customer ordered her eggs over medium, but she didn't want the yolks runny. She was very insistent on this, and said she would send them back if they were runny so I put the order in as over hard eggs because I thought the very definition of over medium is that the yolks are just a bit runny.
She was pissed and sent the over hard eggs back and told me that she didn't want over hard. So next I tried putting them in as over medium but well done and put a note ""yolks not runny"". She sent these back too and was absolutely livid, and complained about my terrible service to the manager.

Spring onion (green onion/scallion) in coq au vin?,"I recently ran into an Australian recipe for coq au vin that called for ""spring onions"", which (in Australia) refers unambiguously to what the French call cébette:

Oddly, the recipe calls for 800g of them (spring onions are sold by bunch, not weight), says you should ""trim green ends, leaving about 4cm of stem attached; trim roots"" (not a whole lot of spring onion left if you follow this!), and then continues with ""cook onion, stirring, until browned all over"", which doesn't seem like the kind of thing you'd usually do to spring onions.
So is spring onion for coq au vin an actual thing in France?  Or did a clueless editor somewhere along the way confuse shallot/échalote in the original (below) with spring onions, which are also known as ""eschalots"" in Australia?

Temperature and Duration for Baking Sweet Potatoes,"I am currently reading in literature about vegetables and came across a section describing how to best prepare sweet potatoes:

Most sweet potato varieties sweeten during cooking thanks to the action of an
  enzyme that attacks starch and breaks it down to maltose, a sugar made up of two
  glucose molecules that’s about a third as sweet as table sugar. Moist or “soggy”
  varieties convert as much as 75% of their starch to maltose, so they seem permeated
  with syrup! The enzyme starts to make maltose when the tightly packed starch granules
  absorb moisture and expand, beginning around 135ºF/57ºC, and it stops when the rising
  heat denatures it, at around 170ºF/75ºC. Slow baking therefore gives the enzyme a
  longer time to work than does rapid cooking in steam, boiling water, or a microwave,
  and produces a sweeter result. Freshly harvested “green” roots available in the autumn
  have less enzyme activity and so don’t become as sweet or moist. [On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen]

So it is clearly stated that sweet potatoes should be baken between roughly 60 to 70°C. Contrary to that I read in a lot of online recipes and cooking ""how-to's"" that they bake the sweet potatoes farely hot, starting at 320°F/160°C for at least 15 minutes.
I want to prepare a pasta, where sweet potatoes, cut into small cubes, shall be one of the main ingredients.
In light of the above stated facts, what temperature and duration can be suggested from your side for baking sweet potatoes?

What went wrong with these pots de creme au chocolat?,"I baked pots de creme au chocolat yesterday following this recipe, but something went wrong:
As you can see in the photos below, the chocolate seems to have separated out, forming a relatively firm top layer, while the remainder underneath is lighter in color and has an unappetizing wet mousse-like texture.

I followed the recipe closely, but let me add some clarifications to avoid ambiguity:

I made the chocolate variant only, so doubled the quantities of dark chocolate (I used 65%) and cocoa
I beat the eggs and sugar in a stand mixer with a wire whisk attachment, then added the infused milk and then the melted chocolate while still mixing on low speed
I poured the resulting mixture into eight 4oz glass canning jars (~3oz per jar). At this point, the mixture appeared to be homogenous.
I arranged the jars in a 9x12x2"" steel pan, placed it into an electric oven preheated to 320 degF, then filled the pan with boiling water to about halfway up the glass jars. 
I baked these until the tops would hardly wobble when I tapped the jars, which was at the 29 min mark
Once I removed the jars from the water bath, the layering was immediately obvious in all eight pots de creme. Interestingly, the bottom of the chocolate layer seems to roughly align with the water level in the bath.
After cooling briefly, I put lids on the jars and refrigerated them for several hours. The photos above are after refrigeration overnight.

The only possibility I can come up with is that I inadvertently filled the pan with cold water. I used an electric kettle, and while I thought I heard it bubbling in the background, my attention was focused on another recipe. Maybe I never switched it on.
Is this a likely explanation for these results? I can see how a cold water bath would result in uneven cooking, but I haven't been able to find good reasoning for why the chocolate would separate out on top.

Reasons for separating eggs in ice cream,"There are a lot of recipes requiring the eggs in the ingredients to be separated. And I know that whipping whole eggs cannot foam up as much as just whipping egg whites.
But why separate eggs in making of the custard for ice cream? Egg whites can foam up better than egg yolks, so it seems counter-intuitive to remove egg whites from the recipe because you would want to incorporate more air into the ice cream, right? :/ I can simply use 1 whole egg for every 2 egg yolks required in the recipe.
I don't think I need to taste egg in ice cream. Can I assume the reason to add egg is just for the color?
Referring to the Wikipedia articles: Yolk, egg yolk is nearly 1/4 fat and 1/3 protein; Egg as food, whole egg is nearly 10% fat and 10% protein. If we ignore the protein and through some clever maths, can I adjust the amount of cream and use whole eggs without separating eggs?

How to prevent carrot juice from turning brown?,"I've been juicing up carrots with a centrifugal juice extractor. There's a lot of overhead (prep and cleanup) so it makes sense to do a big batch and keep it in the fridge for a couple of days.
Unfortunately, the refrigerated juice seems to turn brown pretty quickly. Here it is after 48 hours:

The pulp has precipitated to the bottom and retains its pleasant orange hue, but the juice has turned an ugly and unappetizing brown. It tastes better than it looks, but the flavor has suffered too. It's pretty extreme at 48 hours, but there is significant browning even at 24.
I'm using refrigerated carrots and putting the juice immediately in a plastic screw-top (Ziploc) container in the fridge.

Problem Rolling Out Rough Puff Pastry,"I'm familiar with the proper steps in making rough puff pastry but I have difficulty rolling out the dough. I'm hoping someone can make suggestions or explain how to do it better.
I find it easy rolling out softer doughs - pastry dough or yeast doughs. Rolling out chilled rough puff pastry dough is very difficult though as the butter is hard, making the dough hard too. It takes a lot to push on the rolling pin to roll to size each time. Raising the my height to apply more pressure helps some but not enough.
I'm pretty new to making rough puff pastry so maybe I'm doing something wrong? It's not something I plan to make that often but it would be nice as a dough for Guinness Irish stew.

The art of Sushi: using wasabi to kill parasites,"I've been to many sushi places and last night I went to a place that I've been to before (not that long ago either). When the sushi came, we noticed that it had wasabi spread on the rice, under the fish. 
When we complained we were rudely told that the chef had been doing sushi for 30 years and wasabi is used to kill parasites in the fish.
This is believable since I know in some countries, red peppers are used in foods all the time for the same reason. 
However, my understanding of sushi is that the chef is a craftsman who not only picks great fish, but also knows how to find and remove parasites.
My question is, is this normal? Is it proper for the Sushi chef to add wasabi to the sushi to help prevent parasites? If so, how come I've only encountered this practice once out of the many sushi places I've frequented?

Vegetarian replacement for pork mince in Chinese style stir fry,"In Chinese cuisine it's very common to start a vegetable stir fry with a bit of minced meat, typically pork, to give the dish a deeper flavor.

How do I make paneer firm and chewy like in the restaurant?,"Recently I've taken a liking to Indian cuisine and am trying to replicate the curry experience at home. The biggest problem I'm having is with the paneer cheese, which is used in curries I like the most.
When I eat out at an Indian restaurant, their paneer is firm, squishy and kind of 'squeaky' on the teeth. The one I make is always crumbly and falls apart in the curry. I've tried all kinds of recipes from the net; at one point I even asked a friendly Indian chef about it and he told me that they buy the milk directly from a farmer, and that the low-fat, UHT shop variety just won't do.
I tried reinforcing 2% milk with cream before as per the advice of one recipe or other, but not ""country-milk"" so I got some milk from a friend who keeps cows and the result wasn't much better. The cheese still won't stick together and keeps falling apart, you just can't feel the chewy, curry-flavored bits of paneer at all, so it's pretty useless to even bother with it. Help please?

Why fry rice before boiling?,"Ordinarily when I make fried rice, the general process is:

Boil the rice until done.
Fry the cooked rice in oil.

However, I recently made a different rice recipe which flipped the order:

Lightly fry the dry rice in a pan.
Then boil the rice until done.

This struck me as being really strange.  Why would I lightly fry the rice before cooking it? I usually associate frying rice with textural change, but after boiling it the texture wasn't notably different than if I hadn't fried it at all.
In both cases I was using a medium-grain white rice.

My ginger is moist and floppy... has it spoiled?,"I have a piece of raw ginger root which I bought a couple of weeks ago and stored in the produce drawer of my fridge. I always store my ginger root this way, and it remains usable for weeks.  Today I pulled the piece out and discovered it looked and felt different:

It is a darker yellowish colour
It is flexible instead of crisp and brittle; I can bend it
It is damp, as if it had been soaking in water
It has a tangier, sharper ginger flavour than I remember from other ginger roots

I checked the produce drawer; it is dry. 
I suspect that my piece of ginger has spoiled somehow. Does anyone recognise the signs? Am I right?  If it is spoiled, is it a fluke of that specific piece, or am I storing it wrong?

Crowding loaves in deck oven,"When baking loaves in a commercial deck oven, are there any rules of thumb for how much space is needed around each loaf to bake well? I have noticed that when a few loaves are thrown in by themselves at the end of a bake they seem to cook much quicker and to develop excellent crust color and shine compared to the other loaves. Could it be that the bread doesn't get enough steam on its surface when many loaves are in the oven? I have also noticed that baguettes come out soft on the sides if they are not given sufficient room.
For context, these are mostly lean doughs, some naturally leavened and some yeasted, shaped as rounds and batards and baked at 400-500 F in a deck oven with steam. Some crowding is necessary because of time constraints.

Does (how does) cake batter consistency affect outcomes?,"I've made lots of cake... usually in the form of mini cupcakes.
Generally I find a full cake recipe for a layer cake or even a sheet cake or bundt cake and just put it in mini cupcake pans and bake for about 12-17 minutes, depending on the recipe.
One thing I'm starting to realize is that batter consistency is absurdly varied. Some batters are practically water, like this chocolate cake recipe I made last night. It has very little flour and (228 g) compared to 414 g sugar and 2.5 cups of liquid (water, milk, oil). Other cakes turn out batters that are practically cookie dough thick. Most are somewhere in between.
What are the benefits and hazards of these different consistencies of cake batters? Does it affect crumb, moisture, doming? In the case of cupcakes rather than layer cakes, will one consistency produce more stereotypical cupcakes than others (e.g, say that thin batters make for little doming in the cake, that would be bad for cupcakes, which you want a nice dome on).
For the sake of clarity, let's say that the ""target"" for cupcakes is one that is:

moist but holds together for hand-held consumption
well-domed rather than flat-topped
releases from wrapper easily

And, as a corollary, how can I determine (when picking recipes) which recipes will create different consistencies of batter - is there a liquid to flour ratio common to different consistencies?

How to use and is there a good thermometer for very small small fish?,"I'm trying to check whitebait temperature after cooked and it always seems to be a lower temperature than expected e.g. even after boiling the fish, removing the fish and adding the thermometer, the thermometer can show 40-50c.
I'm currently using this thermometer, however, although it goes in the fish(seemingl fully), perhaps as the fish is so small air is getting to it and so an accurate read isnt been given.

Is my current thermometer inappropriate and are there any specific thermometers which can be used specifically to check small fish such as whitebait.  I imagine the needle has to be very small considering the fish size and most thermometers i find are not much different than the one I linked.

Is it possible that the fish reaches the safe temperature e.g. 62c however as soon as I remove the fish from the water it rapidly cools so by the time the thermometer goes in the fish tempertaure already decreases to say 40c?  If yes how is it best to check fish temperature?

Black tea develops cloudy dregs; how to avoid?,"I'm not much of a tea connoisseur*. But I do know what I like — strong, sweet black tea, and lots of it — and at present, the method I'm using is to boil a cup or so of cold water and about nine cheap tea bags, then turn off the heat and let the whole thing slowly cool on the burner (usually enough that I don't need ice to bring the result to a slightly warm drinking temperature). Then I pour it in a pitcher with some sugar and enough water to bring it to half a gallon; I generally squeeze the bags a bit to avoid waste, although I've tried avoiding that a few times to see if it makes a difference. This tastes nice and stout, and gets me through the average day. I've read some things that suggest steeping tea this long and aggressively will make it horribly bitter, but either those are exaggerations or I have a barbaric tongue, because I haven't noticed any such problems.
The problem I do have is that, especially after a bit of refrigeration, the last half-cup or so of tea has a lot of nasty-looking and nasty-tasting particulates in it. They're fine enough it's difficult to settle them out, even trying various slow pouring methods without disturbing the pitcher much, so presumably the bags don't filter them out either. What can I do about them other than throwing out the dregs? Is there some flawed part of my process that's producing them?

How to bake frozen breaded cod without breading sticking to alumnium foil?,"Context: I'm a poor and lazy college student. I have breaded frozen pieces of cod from costco. I like to bake them in my toaster-oven on aluminum foil to avoid having to clean the baking dish/tray. This brand (janes) is the only kind they have at costco and the problem is the center of the breading sort of sticks to the alumnium foil. 
How can I avoid this? I've thought about applying a small quantity oil , but rather put the effort and money immediately into trying that, I'd like to consult the experts.

Sorbet tastes less sweet when frozen?,"I made some strawberry sorbet. I cut up the strawberries and macerated in lime juice and raw sugar, then cooked them to make them soft so I could use my hand blender to make the puree.

Flavourless Chocolate/Chocolate Alternative in Fudge,"I've just recently gotten into making fudge and have found a recipe that works amazing for almost every flavour I want to make. I use Cocoa Powder or White Chocolate Squares depending on the desired outcome.
But I'm running into a problem when it comes to more delicate flavours (as well as some mixed flavours). The chocolate/white chocolate taste overpowers some of them. (Specifically, so far, Maple Chocolate, Vanilla, and Caramel--but I'm wanting to try fruit flavoured ones and am worried it'll be more of the same)
Is there an alternative to using them? Should I try making a batch without any chocolate of any sort? I'd like to stick with the recipe I have if possible
Thanks in advance

This is the recipe I'm using:

2 cups white sugar
1 cup milk
1/2 cup pure cocoa

1 tsp vanilla

or

2 cups white sugar
1 cup milk
3 oz white baker's chocolate
2 tbsp butter
1-2 tsp of other flavouring

The cocoa is mixed in with the milk and sugar and simmered, while the white chocolate is added after the milk and sugar hit 238oF/114oC--which is why I was wondering if it'd work if I just don't add any chocolate (and add the 4 tbsp of butter rather than the 2 tbsp)

Why do my macarons become lopsided?,"I've recently started making macarons using the Italian meringue method. I got this recipe from a macaron class I attended at the Waitrose Cooking School (in the UK). When I made them at my class, they were perfect, but I can't say the same for making them at home.
I don't think there is anything wrong with my mixture but rather with my oven that is making my macarons either lop-sided, or spew their ""guts"" out.
The meringue is glossy/shiny and gooey when I remove it from the mixer.
The paste is firm.
After mixing the meringue into the paste it's the right consistency i.e not runny and not firm that its doesn't fall off the spatula. It looks a bit like ice-cream if you keep mixing for lack of a better description.
Piping them, they keep their shape and size and have the ""nipple"" on top. Banging them on the counter sets/smooths them and they look ready to go.
The recipe said to have the oven on 145 degrees Celsius (with fan) (293°F) for 14 minutes.
I have one tray in the middle of the oven and my first batch cracked. I left the next batch to set for a few minutes before putting them in and this solved my cracking issue.
Now however, they just spew out the sides and are lop-sided. What could be causing this?
I started trying different temperatures, fan off and on, double tray, putting the tray higher up but nothing really fixed it. 
Is the oven not ventilated enough?
Is it too hot?
Too much moisture? (it's quite humid today and rainy)
I have an electrical single oven (top and bottom elements). 
The best result seemed to be 125 degrees Celsius (257°F) with fan, in the middle with a double tray. No cracks and spillages but just lop-sided (only one side had ""feet""). I tried piping as straight as I could but this didn't seem to help either.

How to make softer frozen whipped cream?,"I recently found out that a few decades ago frozen whipped cream was a thing and my mom liked it. It was similar to normal whipped cream only a bit harder frozen (but still softer than ice cream) and could last for ages in the freezer.
Now I tried to make some for her and it was good, however mine is always too hard while frozen compared to what she loved. When it warms up it is fine and personally I don't find it too hard but whatever.
The process I use is simple, mix cream (36%), some sugar and vanilla extract whip until done and either freeze in one piece or in smaller ones. 
Any ideas how to make it softer while frozen and ideally hard when it thaws? I've thought about adding some milk (it's to late to buy one with less fat) to reduce the fat content or not whipping it as much. Do you think any would work and if so which would you recommend?

How can I add salt and get it to permeate throughout chocolate?,"Based on a previous question I understand it is not possible to make chocolate from home since specialist and expensive equipment is reqiured.  As such I bought premade dark chocolate from the shop, melted it(brang water pot to simmer, added anotther pot wih chocolate in to top of first pot). I then added salt in as I wanted to increase the salt content of the chocolate ensuring the salt is distributed well.
When eating the chocolate I noticed that the salt did not distribute throughout the chocolate and the grains didnt even dissolve properly. large salt grains were present in the chocolate.
I then melted some coconut butter in the same way, added salt and noticed the salt grains didnt dissolve either so clearly need to do more to get the salt to dissolve and distribute.  I added water to the coconut butter and it the salt did dissolve however it seemed to still be seperate from the coconut fat in the same way oil seperates from water.  I then added coco powder.  When I ate it although the salt grains did dissolve it still seems not to have distributed/penetrated the chocolate well.
Chocolate bars with a high salt content e.g. twirl, flake have the result i'm looking for i.e salt is distributed well throughout.  Anyone know how i can get premade chocolate, add salt and get it to distribute like the aforementioned bars, or cook from scratch getting the salt to distribute properly?  I cant just use the aforementioned premade bars because they have many other ingredients which I'm trying to avoid. 
-- UPDATE --
I have just noticed that the chocolate bars I have been comparing to e.g. twirl, flake do not have salt added as an ingredient.  However they still have 0.25g of salt per 100g of chocolate.  I guess it means its naturally occuring as a result of one of the ingredients or managing to merge that ingredient with the other ingredient hence getting the seemingly well distriuted salt.  Does anyone know which ingredient gives it the salt(I'd guess milk).  If I wanted to then emulate the recipe would I simply melt chocolate as previously and then add milk, is there some possible way to make the salt distribution like aformentioned store bought chocolates now that I know it definately wasnt as a result of adding/cooking salt?

How can I maximize ginger extraction?,"I want to make ginger drinks (bourbon, hot tea, ginger ale). In all cases, I want to create a ginger syrup that I can then add to bourbon, hot water, soda water to get my desired drink. I have tried the following methods:

Slice ginger thinly, put in boiling water for 1 hour
Chop ginger very finely, bring water to boil, cover, steep one hour
Chop ginger very finely, bring water to simmer for one hour
Puree ginger and small amount of water in vita mix

In all cases, I've found that I need to remove the leftover ginger, as it would just settle out of a drink. I've tried it with varying amounts of sugar (from none to 1:2 sugar:water). What I'm left with is a pretty good product, but the ginger has a lot of flavor left in it. In fact, I can use it again with the same process and still get a good result. 
I would like to get a very strong product with minimal life left in the ginger, so that I can minimize the amount of ginger I use. I'd also like the syrup / extract to be as strong as possible to minimize the amount I add to my drink. To top it off, I would prefer the process not be to laborious or time consuming. 
How can I maximize the extraction of ginger flavor in to a liquid?

Induction range vs gas,"In the next few months I have a kitchen remodel planned. One item to be replaced is the range/oven. Currently we have a ""vintage"" electric stove.
I am undecided as to whether to choose gas or an induction model. I had gas in a previous house and I really liked it. However, I have reservations about combustion gases and unhealthy effects on air quality. I have heard great things about induction ranges, but my biggest reservation there is that I'll need to replace a fair bit of cookware. Personally, I have no experience using induction.
My question is mainly directed at those who have used both induction and gas, but if you've used either that's ok as well. So, given a choice between induction or gas, which would you choose? 
P.S. - Not sure if this should be a community wiki, but if so I'm good with that.
Update
I was hoping to hear from someone who uses an induction range. The ideal answer would be something like, ""I've used gas and induction and when I bought a new range I bought ""x"" and here's why"". Anyway it's not an ideal world...
My issue is that I have used gas for cooking and know lots of others who do as well. I have one friend who used an induction range in a vacation home, and her take was that she hated it at first, but then came to like it. Another friend has a countertop induction burner, but he's not a cook as he just uses it to boil water. The thing is that induction ranges are not very common in the U.S. or at least among people I know.
So, to refine what I'm interested in.... If you are an avid cook, and have used an induction system, ""Is it responsive?"", ""Is it controllable, in that say, you can set a burner at 180 and it'll stay there?"", ""Is it durable and easy to clean?"".
Also, my reservation about replacing cookware pretty much went away. I found flooring materials through salvage for less than half of what I expected to pay. That pretty much opened up my budget if I decide to go with induction rather than gas.
Finally, what I really need to do is find a way to test drive an induction range. I'll be checking in with some local shops to see if there is a way to accomplish that. 
And by the way, I have of course googled on this.
Thanks for the input so far.
Another Update
I was hoping to get more comparative experience in using gas and induction. I suppose I didn't get much of that because induction ranges do not have wide usage in the U.S. market. 
I know that I generally like cooking on gas ranges. My main concern with gas is indoor air pollution. Somewhere among my bookmarks is an article about particulate matter and CO generated by gas ranges. 
On the other hand, I really like some of the things I've read about induction ranges. Efficiency, safety, control, etc. 
My final decision on what I actually wind up purchasing is down the road a bit. Hopefully, I'll get to ""test drive"" an induction range in the meantime.

Are there safety concerns with cooking something with beer or wine in the oven?,"Probably a silly question, and I have never heard of an incident, but then again that does not rule out a safety issue. Basically, if I want to put a covered pot in the oven with beer or wine (or some other alcohol), is there a safety concern, or a pre-oven step that must be done? The reasoning is that if the alcohol cooks off as a gas, could it be trapped in the oven, and heat up until it explodes or starts a fire?
For now, I usually add the beer or wine to the pot on the stove, and let it heat up uncovered for a few minutes before the oven.

Problems Sprouting Soybeans,"I've sprouted mung beans (many times) and a few other seeds successfully. I understand the process well. I've now tried sprouting soybeans a number of times but I can't make it past soaking.
After soaking them overnight, I found the beans were soft almost to the point where I could mash them between thumb and finger. Most of the skins had come loose which I expected but quite a few beans had also separated into halves. The first time, I carefully picked through them, trying to remove obvious non-sproutable ones. After the first rinsing, it was hopeless and I tossed them. I bought fresh beans at a different places thinking it might've been a fluke but the same thing happened.
I got thinking and wonder if the soybeans may have been heat treated to prevent sprouting. Monsanto has GMO soybeans but I have no idea if the majority of soybeans sold in stores are theirs. Monsanto zealously guards their products by legal means and it made me wonder if they also guard against consumers growing their seeds by heat treating, in this case at least.
Has anyone an idea if that might be the reason I can't get beyond the soaking stage? If so, I'll buy some non-GMO soybeans from a health food store. If anyone has had success, please let me know. I've bought soybean sprouts from a Chinese market before but the closest one that sells them is at least an hour drive away.

Oh boy, this is a chemical reaction! Eggs contain sulfur, and oranges contain E300 (acid you know) so this becomes sulfuric acid! That's why.

Has anyone experimented systematically with this?
EDIT: This is distinct from the question of whether there are vegan egg substitutes that can be used in cakes.  Since eggs do multiple things to cakes and since these roles are emphasized more or less depending on the cake, there is not going to be a single answer to ""what is a good egg substitute for cakes?"".  I asked this question to try to learn specifically about whether there are ways to mimic the protein network that eggs create in cakes using vegan proteins.

Is it safe to not wash mushrooms?,"Most chefs stress the fact that white button mushrooms, and others, should not be washed to be cleaned. They say to either lightly brush them or just pat them with a cloth or paper towel to get the ""dirt"" off to clean them, and then cook or eat them raw. Do not ""wash"" them, to clean them, because the chefs says the mushrooms get waterlogged, and they believe something happens to the taste.
Well, as a little girl my Dad took me to a mushroom farm. It was disgusting because of the smell of manure.  The mushrooms were in trays, enveloped totally in the manure in trays, that were stacked high according to the sizes and I don't remember what else.  We were in darkness, and my Dad would go from one area to the next buying trays from all over. Years later, I became the buyer and I don't remember much other than the awful smell, the sizes, the darkness and how much I still loved to eat mushrooms. To prepare I washed them with water, got off all the excess manure, and depending on how the mushroom was to be prepared, stuffed, quick boiled in lots of salt then kept in that same salted water to be eaten with sour cream, fried with butter, prepared them many ways.
My question is, why do chefs insist that you should not wash, only use their method, lightly brush or towel off the mushroom? Isn't safety a reason to wash? And washing doesn't change the flavor, right?

Otherwise, how can I tell which are good when cooked? Thank you.

Getting butter from yogurt,"The common way for taking butter from milk is to shake the cream captured from milk. There is also a traditional way to shake yogurt to separate butter. However, I was unable to find any instruction for separating butter from yogurt.
Although, separating butter from high-fat cream is quite easy, but full separation of cream from milk at home is almost impossible. However, transferring milk to yogurt is quite easy. Therefore, there is an advantage for getting butter from yogurt (rather than cream), when the starting point is raw milk.

Why this method is not popular? Is there any drawback for that?
Where to find a practical instruction for this procedure? the
best temperature? using Greek (heavy) yogurt or adding water to

How to make century eggs?,"I have discovered century eggs while living in Thailand, and instantly fell in love with these treats. Unfortunately, I haven't lived in Thailand for a few years now, and I desperately miss century eggs. It's impossible to purchase them anywhere within 1000 km radius, so I guess the only option is to make them myself.
So, I need an advice, how can I recreate this mesmerizing gift of Asian cuisine?
What have I tried so far — I have followed this recipe on Instructables, which in short was:

Made brine by combining 42g NaOH + 72g NaCL + 1L water, boiled, dissolved and let it cool down. I have used pipe drain cleaner (100% NaOH).
Carefully put four chicken eggs in a glass jar, poured brine until eggs became fully submerged.
Put a small glass weight on top to prevent eggs from floating.
Kept them in brine for 10 days at approx 18°C.
Removed eggs from brine. Found two eggs to crack, with only disfigured yolk remaining inside.
Thoroughly washed two remaining intact eggs with tap water, then dried them up completely with paper towels.
Tightly wrapped eggs in few layers of clear thin plastic wrap, then covered them in modeling clay shell.
Kept them for 20 days this way.

After time was up, I opened them, to find out to my own disappointment that my experiment had failed. The eggs were filled with a foul-smelling opalescent runny fluid about the density and viscosity of water, and the eggs themselves had shrunk away to the size of the yolk. The egg whites had stayed white, dense and opaque, and only a thin layer of it was left around the yolk. The yolks themselves were still yellow with a slight blue tint, and had overall texture of hard-boiled yolk.
Obviously, this was not the result I wanted, so I threw them away without tasting :(
Since then I have done a few more attempts, still with no luck. I have even discovered scientific papers on this matter, e.g. ""Effects of alkaline concentration, temperature, and additives on the strength of alkaline-induced egg white gel."", Zhao Yan et al, doi: 10.3382/ps.2013-03596, however I was somewhat hesitant about experimenting on myself, as the paper gave no conclusions whether the provided metal salt concentrations are safe for human health with prolonged consumption. 
So, can anyone point out any mistakes I've made during my attempts, or provide me with the right technique to make Century Eggs that I can follow? It is surprisingly difficult to find English recipes for these on the Internet.

Mixing the few drops in a very thick base sauce and then add it to the rest of a more liquid (watery) sauce.
Mixing a few drops in oil. They mix quite well, but not entirely. Then put the oil in the dish.

My guess is that the oleoresin does not dilute or dissolve well in the dish and stays confined in fat globules, so that they go straight through the stomach without interacting much with the mouth.

How can I improve my fried rice?,"I'm an amateur cook with almost no experience (never taught by my parents, first time cooking on my own was first few days living on my own), so I'm studying very hard because I want to be a great cook for the people living with me.
I'm trying to nail down the teppanyaki fried rice made at some very popular restaurants that I've visited several years back.
It seems that I'm definitely missing something with the technique. The meat and veggies I have no problem with. I cut up the chicken or beef into strips and cook it in the pan with a moderate amount of teppanyaki sauce, and it turns out great.
For the rice, what I do is cook jasmine rice (in a stock made with chicken bouillon) a day or two ahead and keep it in the fridge. I cook on a large round stainless steel pan (I'm not experienced enough in cooking to be properly taking care of cast iron cookware) at medium-to-high heat (7-8 on my stove), and begin by adding the rice, vegetable oil, and some peas and onion. I mix these up and then add a decent amount of soy sauce until it's a decent color. I scramble the egg separately then add it in when it is mostly done, mixing it in with the rice and veggies. I then add the cooked meat and veggies last.
Two main problems:

The rice seems to stick together too much. It appears to be rather sticky in the fridge, but separates rather easily. After frying though, I have this big hunk of rice that sticks together with some other ingredients dotted within.
The egg flavor seems to get all over the rice. Even when I scramble the egg, the ""chunk"" tend to become smaller than I anticipate once I add this to the rice, and the flavor is much too strong compared to the rice or veggies.

What do I need to change to get this closer to restaraunt quality? I'm quite new to cooking, so I really don't know what to look out for or what to change.
Please note that I'm trying to cut down on sugar and sodium, so I don't want to add excess salt or soy sauce.

What's the best way to cook BBQ ribs in the oven and grill?,"I have some pork ribs that I want to barbecue, but being relatively inexperienced with BBQ and lacking a decent grill thermometer, I want to simplify things by cooking them partly in the oven and partly in the grill. Researching online has thrown up many variations as to temperature, timing, and which order to cook them in. So, some sub-questions:

Is it better to grill the ribs first, then put them in the oven, or vice versa?
In either case, is it best to use indirect or direct heat on the grill to get the necessary smokiness and glaze?
What temperature should the ribs be cooked at in the oven and for roughly how long (I know outcome is more important than timing)
Should the ribs be wrapped in foil in the oven for the entire cook?

FWIW my instinct is to grill (with some wood chips for smoke) first, then oven, but my concern then is how to get a good glaze.

Help with thinly slicing garlic,"I buy bulk peeled garlic. When I bring it home I always throw some in the food processor and freeze it in single use aliquots. That's fine for daily kind of use, but for fancier stuff I really like garlic thinly sliced. Unfortunately, what used to be easy is becoming more difficult. My hands often shake and cramp up when I try to do fine, detailed tasks. To make matters worse, I have cut myself several times in recent weeks.
I'm considering getting a mini-mandoline like this: Garlic Slicer Is there anything in particular I should look for in a mandoline for very thin slices? I don't own a mandoline of any type, so it would be sweet if I could find one that handles garlic well and can do bigger slices too, like potatoes for a gratin.
In the meantime, does anybody have any good tricks for slicing garlic old school (with a knife and cutting board)? I find that if I try to do more than one clove at a time, they slide around on the board making even slices difficult. Even one at a time, I find it hard to hold the last half of the clove without risking a trip to the emergency room.

He could not remember where he read it, but he said it has something to do with an enzyme that is only contained in the germ, hence you should remove it.

"""Universal"" aka ""Bristle"" Knife Blocks: Blade Damage and Hygiene","Does anyone have any experiences of /advice about ""universal"" knife blocks, i.e. blocks that hold the knives in place with a dense bunch of plastic bristles instead of the usual slots in the wood.

The problem is that they are all different makes and (I presume?) a ceramic steel isn't magnetic so a strip is out.(Besides, I hear ceramic steels are easy to damage so a block would provide more protection).
The solution would appear to be a ""universal"" knife block that could accommodate all brands, but I'd like to know:

"Is ""until juices run clear"" a valid test for poultry doneness? Why or why not?","I've come across this particular recommendation many times in various recipes and cookbooks and probably even given it out myself once or twice.  Poultry is sufficiently cooked when the juices run clear, not red or pink.
In recent months and years, as I've grown more interested in and knowledgeable about the science of cooking, I've learned to be skeptical of such simplistic claims.  This one is repeated everywhere - even the Ontario Ministry of Health says it - but I've also run across various claims that it is dangerous advice.
What I'd like to know is this:
What does it actually mean - chemically or biologically speaking - when poultry juices run clear?  Is it actually a reliable indicator that the food is safe to eat?
P.S. I am quite well aware that the way one is supposed to test for doneness is to use a thermometer and ensure that the internal temperature has reached 165° F / 74° C.  I always do this, but thermometers can break, run out of battery, etc., so I think it is still helpful to know if the juice test is ever a viable alternative.  But most importantly I am interested in understanding what is happening to the meat that causes the juices to change colour, and under what other conditions this can happen.

How to clean an octopus - and is it worth it,"I've bought an octopus from my fish monger, but, when I asked if he could clean it, he openly admitted he's never done octopus before and doesn't know how. Well, neither do I but I've taken it on myself. This is clearly a poor decision, I don't even like gutting fish!
I'm reading up on this, and a certain website says the following

Octopus must also be cleaned, so you may want to ask your fish monger to do it if you're uncomfortable doing so yourself. Hold the head under running water to simply remove and discard the ink sac, stomach, and eyes. Then use a sharp knife to cut out the beak, which is found at the bottom of the head

I'm very lost with this statement; it seems like the article suggests by holding the head under water, everything will just fall away (doubtful otherwise it would have a rubbish time being a sea creature!). Has it glossed over the 'how' because it's very difficult?
More reading on other sites suggests that the head is very gelatinous and the vast majority of meat/flavor is  from the arms.
So, based upon my own research (if it is correct), is it worth cleaning an octopus (and if so, can some one explain how) or would I be better off just chopping the head off (and removing the beak) and discarding them, keeping just the legs/arms?

How do I feed a sourdough starter?,"The cookbook I'm using tells me how to make a sourdough starter, but not how to feed it after I take out what I need for the bread. What do I do with the starter once I've used some? I don't think I'll use all of it at once.
","bread, sourdough, starter"
How frequently should I feed my sourdough starter?,"I am growing my first sourdough starter. It is a week old, but it isn't very active. My concern is that I might be feeding it too frequently or too infrequently. I could see it going either way.
The process I have been using is to (initially) combine 100 grams of Breadflour and 100 grams of water in a bowl and whisk with a fork, then cover with a towel. Day two (at 24 hours), I added 100 grams of each ingredient to the bowl and mixed in without removing anything.
By day 3 (24 hours again), I had a slightly sour smell and noticed some bubbles. There was also a tan skin that formed over part of the starter, which I removed. I couldn't tell if it was fuzzy or not. 
That evening, I watched a video where a lady was talking about how you need to feed your starter every 4-12 hours and then later in the video she said every 12 - 18 hours. I was wondering if I was starving my starter.
On Day 4 (12 hours later instead of 24) I divided the starter in half, fed one half, and decided to try making bread with the other half (I know it was early, but I figured I might as well try since I would otherwise be throwing it away). The bread actually turned out really well, at least it did for having a weak starter and having never made sourdough before.
Anyway, I went back to the 24 hour feeding schedule because the lady who said 12 hours also said that her starter doubles in volume during the feeding. Mine never changes in volume, it just gets some bubbles. 
My concern is that if the yeast isn't bubbling a lot, that may mean that it isn't eating its food quickly. If it isn't eating its food quickly, then it may not be saturating the starter. So if I feed it to early, I would be diluting the starter more than I would be helping it grow. Like, you feed a well saturated starter and half that mixture is starter, the other half is food. Then you feed it again too soon and the starter (immediately prior to feeding) is only at 75%. But you feed it and now the starter makes up 32.5% of the mixture instead of 50%. then this pattern repeats until you eliminate the starter from the mixture.
Am I thinking about this correctly? Instead of time, is there something else that I should be using to determine when to feed instead of time? Is there some variable I am not considering?

-Filtered water from refrigeratorstarter image from top
-Breadflour

Why can only white fish be already gutted on board the ship?,"I stumbled upon the wikipedia article about white fish:

Unlike oily fish, white fish contain oils only in their liver, rather than in their gut, and can therefore be gutted as soon as they are caught, on board the ship. 

Why of all other properties is the presence of fat in the guts a criterion for gutting a fish aboard or not? 
If I didn't read that wikipedia article I would have guessed that the size / amount of the catch and the level of invested and installed automation decides whether the fish is gutted on board or not. Some years ago a fisherman in the north sea told shrimps caught there are shipped frozen to Turkey to be peeled by manual laborers and then shipped back to be sold. I thought the same thing is done with ""smaller"" fish (maybe sized like a cod and smaller?).

Beef Steaks : Cooking older-grade meat (C-Grade),"I'm an amateur cook and I can't afford to buy ""good"" steaks, so I made my own Sous Vide circulator to try and get the best out of cheap meat cuts. Thing is, where I'm from, even the less-glamorous cuts of A-Grade beef is too expensive for me. So I buy C-Grade rump, which is basically meat from older animals.
My question is: How do I adjust my Sous Vide temperatures and times for the older beef? I tried a 1-inch rump steak at 65C for 2 hours and it came out dry cos all the juices from the meat seemed like it oozed out into the bag. I salted it before the sous vide phase.
I previously tried a big piece of rump on a 16 hour cook time, and it was also very dry cos all the juices had come out into the bag.
What are my option to make a decent steak out of C-Grade rump?
EDIT#1: So a few suggestions that my temp controller isn't accurate... I do have a candy thermometer lying around. I'll try double-checking it against that. Also, from the other question that was linked, there's  a suggestion to hold back on the seasoning until after the cook is done. I'll give that a try next time. I've looked at Douglas Baldwin's ""Practical Guide to Sous Vide Cooking"" and I think I might try a sub-60C cook to extract the magic from this passage:

Indeed, collagen begins to dissolve into gelatin above 122°F to 131°F (50°C to 55°C) (Neklyudov, 2003; This, 2006). Moreover, the sarcoplasmic protein enzyme collagenase remains active below 140°F (60°C) and can significantly tenderize the meat if held for more than 6 hours (Tornberg, 2005).

EDIT#2 : See my link below. It's a scholarly article on fibrous connective tissue, which makes comments about older animals and the effect on collagen. It's a bit over my head, but might be interesting to anyone who has the appetite for food science...

How do high-end restaurants promote such intense flavour in vegetables?,"Yesterday I was lucky enough to eat lunch in a Michelin-starred restaurant. 
One course consisted, as far as I could tell, of nothing but a selection of lightly cooked baby beetroot and deep-fried shallot rings. Yet the flavours in both vegetables were enormous, so intense that they were enough to carry such an apparently simple dish all by themselves. Furthermore I could easily differentiate between the different varietals of beetroot on the plate, something I don't think I've experienced before.
While no doubt expertly seasoned, the dish was not overly salty: I drank no more water than usual during or after the meal. And since the beetroot were just halved, they cannot have been reduced in any way to concentrate the flavour.
What do high-class restaurants do to their ingredients to promote such incredible flavour? Given the semi-raw state of the beetroot, I can only imagine it's down to selection of the best, most in-season produce. But at the same time I find that hard to believe. What else could be at play here? And where do I have to look in order to find produce of that quality for my own kitchen?

Tiny beads/flecks of uncooked dough all through my bread,"I'm not sure exactly what aspect of my bread-making is at fault here, but this is close to my tenth loaf, and each one has turned out a bit differently as I've tried to work on my technique to produce better results. A couple of times the loaves have been perfect but the last three have consistently had these little doughy flecks all through the loaf, surrounded by a nice well-cooked texture.
Here is a picture of today's loaf:

I live in Brisbane, Australia, and most days during this learning curve have been at the very least in the high 20's, and often around the 30-31C mark (85-90F). The humidity can get quite high too, often 60-90%.
I'm using a crusty white bread mix from Laucke Mills, which is basically bread flour with some kind of bread improver mixed in. Here are the steps I take:

I activate the yeast by adding it to the specified quantity of water (tepid, roughly lukewarm) along with a teaspoon or so of sugar, mix it up and let the yeast activate (5-10 mins)
I add the specified quantity of flour to the mixing bowl and add the activated yeast and water mix a well in the middle, then mix with a large metal mixing spoon until a have a sticky hunk of unkneaded dough. It generally looks like the pictures in other guides I have read.
I flour the breadboard with a thin-ish layer of flour (I have a really large breadboard, so there's enough space), spread the flour around with my hands and then tip the rough, sticky doughy ball into the middle.
I start kneading, and have been trying to speed up the rate at which i fold, knead and turn, because, despite using the exact quantities of flour and water specified, I find the stickiness of the dough makes it stick to my hands really quickly, and if that happens, I end up having to rub my hands to uncake the dough onto the side (I'm not letting the caked bits get back into the dough, so that can't be the issue). Even then, it's hard to knead the dough to a point where I get that thin gluten window every guide out there claims that I should be able to see after 10-15 minutes of kneading.
Eventually the dough ball seems consistent enough, so I then proof it in a lightly oiled mixing bowl for 40 minutes or so, as that's how long it takes in this weather to roughly double in size.
Next I punch the dough down a bit and then upend it back onto the now-clean breadboard, flatten it out a bit to try and release the gas, then shape it into a roughly bread-like shape.
I allow it to rise in the tin (with baking paper) for roughly 30 minutes, as that's how long it seems to take to get a significant rise, then I put it in the oven, which supposedly should be around 220C by now. I also put a tray of boiling water at the bottom of the oven, as various guides seem to recommend.

After about 40 minutes, the result is what you see in the picture. On this occasion I tried to put it back and each time I pulled it out, I cut off a test slice to see if the extra time had been the issue. The doughy bits did cook a bit more by the third replacement, but eventually the crust got too brown and hard and I knew it was time for a postmortem.
Would greatly appreciate any advice.

Homemade Coconut Yogurt Turned Yellow on Top Overnight,"I'm making my first little foray into the wonderful world of cultured food making, and have been trying my hand at Coconut Yogurt (this is attempt #4). I have a crock pot that I fill with water, plug into a thermostat, put the probe in the water and set it to 110F. I put the yogurt in a mason jar in the crock pot, make sure the water is higher than the yogurt line, and leave it overnight.
Precursor: yesterday I made a batch, but neglected to sterilize my jar, so I grew both pink and yellow something (I assumed bacteria, rather than mold, because of the colors) overnight. I then learned that pink seems to be the first color your yogurt will start to turn generally when something wasn't quite sterilized properly.
This bring us to my most recent batch - I washed the jar with soap, water, and coarse salt. Shook it for ages, scrubbed with a brush, rinsed with hot water. Boiled twice in a stock pot (I was determined to get it right this time) as well as the lid. I brought my coconut milk to 180 degrees while stirring in 1tbsp of tapioca flour as a thickener, and 1tbsp of granular white sugar, to give the cultures a bit more food. Once I hit 180F and was almost simmering, I pulled it from the heat, and let it cool down to 110F. I opened a new store-bought coconut yogurt with live cultures, plain, unsweetened, and put a spoonful into my coconut milk mixture, stirred gently, then put the lid on and set it in the crock bath at 110F for about 12-14 hours.
This morning I pulled out the jar to take a look. About 1/8th to 1/10th of the top of my volume was a layer of watery liquid, I assume Coconut's equivalent to whey. This may be tinted slightly yellow, but looks relatively clear to me. When I look down from the top, though, there's a brighter shade of yellow that's formed in splotches on the surface. To me, it looks similar to the pink I saw yesterday, only yellow. I've never successful made a batch before and do know there should be some yellow tinting to you whey, at least when it's cow's milk. I'll attach the best picture I could take. My question is: how do I know if this yellow is okay or not okay? If it's grown some alien again today after boiling the jar twice, how can I keep things even more sanitary to prevent this? 
Update - after an extra ~12 hours or so (24 hours total) at 110F, the yellow is now way more profound. Now it clearly looks off to me, but hoping someone can tell me what's up with it. Here's a picture of how it looks now:

Could adding oil to boil benefit the taste and texture of the pasta?,"Note to mods: this is not a duplicate.  I am not concerned about pasta sticking.
Note to anyone who wants to stand on their heritage and say only their way is best: I am Italian, I am 45, I have been cooking for my family for my entire adult life, as well as various jobs in food service.

A point of contention between myself and my wife is how we cook pasta.  The main differences are: she adds a little oil to the water, I drizzle it in the colander after rinsing; she adds the salt to cold water, I add the salt after the water has boiled.
She prepared the pasta the other night.  She had me finish to al dente.  It was obvious to the eye that there was a bit of oil swirling in the water.
She hadn't prepared pasta in quite some time (I am a Fascist about some food prep).  And since I haven't tasted it prepared her way in some time, I have to say: it was really good.  The pasta (cavatappi) seemed softer somehow.  I even had some the next day, after having sat in the fridge overnight.  It was still very soft and flavorful.
I only rinsed the pasta (didn't also drizzle oil post-rinse).  Putting the leftovers away after dinner, the pasta was not sticking terribly.
So, again, I know this is not the traditional way of preparing a pot of pasta.  But I have to say, it was delicious.
I guess what I'm looking to find out is whether anyone has some science to back up why adding oil to the boil would improve taste and texture.
Thanks.

Using a vacuum sealer to marinate?,"With the vacuum sealers that have hit the market, they're have been a lot of toys added onto the products.  One such device is used for marinating meat.

Bread cracks in the oven,"I'm having trouble with my hamburger buns cracking in the oven.

click to expand
In this photo you can see a a bun with the crust cap cracking, isolating the bottom portion and exposing the crumbs. I used to have Hamilton Beach mixer for kneading and never had any issues. I set the Hamilton Beach mixer on speed 4 for 10 minutes. But now I got a KitchenAid Artisan mixer, and am having trouble with the exact same recipe.
I first tried to follow the KitchenAid instructions to knead only for two minutes at speed 3 which didn't work out well and the dough failed the window pane test. I then searched and found some advice to knead at speed 4 for about 10 minutes. I did and my dough passed the window pane test but somehow after rising during the shaping the crust/surface of the buns show a non-smooth surface (happens a lot more on whole wheat). What are some of the reasons this happens? The same recipe works perfectly with the Hamilton Beach mixer. Any advice on the technicalities would be appreciated. 
I've read What causes the crown of the bread to crack during baking? (and I appreciate people citing that). But that question is about a loaf, and it's normal for loaves to crack like that, and normal to score loaves. Hamburger buns, in contrast, are not generally scored, and the recipe I'm making is not supposed to require it. It's worked fine without scoring sometimes, so there's something else going wrong besides the lack of scoring.

"Where did the thin, smooth plastic spatulas go?","20 years ago, the most common type of rigid spatula (or ""turner"") was smooth, thin (as in 3mm or less with a sharp edge), and generally made of nylon.  These spatulas were not very durable (leading edges tended to melt), but they were very very good for making eggs and other delicate non-stick-pan dishes.  And they were dirt cheap ($1 or so).
Here's pictures of the kind of spatula/turner I'm talking about:

By 10 years ago, these excellent egg turners had completely vanished from store shelves.  At this point, I can't find them, even at thrift stores.  Today's plastic turners are thick, blunt-edged, and rough ... absolutely terrible for crepes or omlettes.  I'm down to my last 2 hoarded smooth thin plastic turners.
I've searched online, and I can't find any kind of health scare, trend or other information on what would have caused manufacturers to universally change how they made plastic turners.   I also can't find anywhere to buy the old style.
So, this question is two-fold:

Why did manufacturers stop making thin, smooth plastic turner spatulas?
Where, if anywhere, can I buy this style of spatula?

AMENDED PER ANSWER BELOW: I am not talking about melamine spatulas, which are rigid.  Both of the spatulas in the picture are semi-flexable.
Amended for more clarity: Per the discussion below, I did some actual measuring. The spatulas in question are sharp edged at the front, around 1-1.5mm on the edge, and no more than 3mm in the center.
FOR THE BOUNTY: either tell me where I can buy a new spatula like the ones pictured, OR explain why they're no longer available ... with a reference.  Thanks!

Ceramic Cooktop (non induction) getting damaged after use,"We just moved into a brand new unit(just constructed) and it has a Ceramic cook top. We have only been there 2-3 weeks, and cooked maybe < 10 times.
After a few of our cooking sessions, I am seeing some white coloration around the edge of the cooking circle. It appears to be below the surface, I cant feel anything different around that area. It was below my cookware and I dont think anything splashed on it. 
It might be due to the following cases

We used oversized cookware which was actually sitting on the raised edge of the stove and perhaps not actually touching the glass surface.
On a different occasion we used a different situation we used a vessal with a smaller base than the smaller circle, and thus possibly the edges of the circle got overheated or something.. 

We are very new to ceramic cook tops, mostly experienced with gas, minimal experience with induction. I notice some places suggesting that the cookware base is recommended to be >= size of the circle, is this the cause of our problem?

Does milk tenderize meat?,"In another question I suggested that milk might be used as a tenderizer. That generated an amount of scepticism, so I think it is worth breaking the question out.

""...if you skip the browning and cook the meat in milk (or any other liquid) at the outset, you limit the temperature of the meat to around 212 degrees. [...] As a result, meat cooked in milk does not dry out...""

If it's for the yeast to eat, I don't quite know how much flour I would want to substitute to make up for the loss of the honey. 
If it improves the texture of the dough or finished bread, I have no idea how to make modifications to the recipe. I've read that with this kind of flour, people have better luck with texture by allowing the flour to soak for longer. 
How can I remove the honey from this recipe and end up with a decent bread?
Edit: oops, I just noticed the comments on the page suggest removing the honey. Could I get a second opinion on that, I guess?

"Why do we like dessert, but not extremely salty, sour, umami, or bitter foods alone?","This is a ""soft"" question that's been bothering me for a while.
When cooking savory dishes, we usually try to balance out the five basic flavors (sweet, salty, sour, umami, and bitter) so that none of them dominates. None of these flavors should overwhelm the dish, but when present in the right ratios we will perceive a dish as tasting good.
On the other hand, we also enjoy dishes that are mostly sweet. In Western cultures these are eaten as dessert, usually after the savory portion of a meal, though in some other cultures (e.g. in Japan) sweet foods are traditionally eaten separately from savory meals. We do like having hints of the other four flavors in sweet dishes (e.g. salt in chocolate chip cookies, bitterness in coffee-flavored ice cream, etc.) but sweetness is certainly the dominating flavor.
My question is: why don't we have salty, sour, bitter, or umami equivalents of ""dessert""? In other words, why do we not, for example, have a separate dish at meals which is overwhelmingly sour, which only a hint of the other flavors? Why is sweetness unique in this regard?

Why is my espresso salty?,"We've got a fancy espresso machine in our office kitchen. (It's apparently the kind they used to use at Starbucks stores before they switched over to a more automated ""point-and-click"" type system.) I was trained on how to use the machine by an old pro, and have been successfully making delicious cups of espresso for a few months. 
Lately, my espresso tastes distinctly salty. 
I haven't changed the process at all. It has happened on a few separate days, with many other people using the machine, so I doubt it is an issue related to the substance used for cleaning the machine (since I believe that would have been flushed out between my attempts). I haven't heard any other complaints from the 50 (or so) other people who use the same beans, grinder, and espresso machine. 
It's a mystery to me, but salty coffee is gross, so it's a mystery that needs solving. (My theory is that I've unwittingly altered my method in some tiny way that I haven't noticed, and that has changed the taste of my espresso. I just don't know what that alteration was!)
Edit: I had a thought: This morning, I made a cup that was salty enough that I didn't want to drink it at all. I poured it out and made another from the other basket on the same machine. It was salty, but drinkable. Potential clue?
'nother edit: Yesterday, my coffee was less salty. The only difference in my method was that I rinsed the basket for way longer than I usually do. It still tasted a little bit off (in the salty direction), but not nearly as bad as previous cups.

Can I steam-cook food in a distiller?,"I have a counter-top water distiller which I have been using to make distilled water, and it's been working fine for this purpose. Recently, my artichoke plant has produced artichokes ready for harvest, and I had the idea I could use the distiller to steam-cook them.
The possible advantages I can think of are:

Distiller would automatically shutoff when the water is boiled away.
I could set the cooking time by how much water I put in.
No steam escaping into the environment. (I live in a small room, and it gets damp in here too easily.)
Producing distilled water at the same time.

However, the possible disadvantages I can think of are:

Contaminants from the water might splash up and ruin the food.
Difficulty finding a stand to keep the artichoke out of the water.
The particles of artichoke might contaminate the steam, causing the distiller's charcoal filter or even the inside of its pipes to clog.

Anyone actually try this or know of probable problems I haven't thought of?

Cast Iron and Smoke,"I've had my cast iron for several weeks now and have been able to cook with it about 10 times. The problem is, the amount of smoke, and timing of it, have me thinking I'm doing something wrong...
I seasoned it 3 times with canola oil (put in oven at 500 degrees for 1 hour), and only cook with avocado oil (because of its high smoke point).
After letting the pan pre-heat on the ""4"" setting on the stove (medium heat basically), the smoke appears right when I place the oil in the pan. Now, avocado oil is suppose to have one of the highest smoke points, and for the pan to start smoking at medium heat has me very very confused.

Sous vide pasteurization for pregnant wife,"long time StackOverflow user (and home cook). My wife is now almost 5 months pregnant, and whilst initially I didn't want to serve her sous vide food (she didn't want any) 5 months of non sous vide meals has taken its toll on her!
After looking into sous vide pasteurization it would seem that as long as food is pasteurized, it is super safe (if not safer than any other method).
So am I right in thinking, that as long as food has reached its pasteurized temp for the right time, there are no food safety issues (regarding pregnant women etc).
So technically I could serve her a rare(ish) steak, cooked at 136F, if I slow cooked it over say 8 hours?
Likewise, the first meal I was going to attempt was sous vide ribs, 8 hours at 164F (to be safe).

Should I flip a roasting chicken in lieu of having a rotisserie?,"I don't have a rotisserie, but would love to impart some of the flavor that seems to come with rotisserie cooking.  The rotisserie chickens I've had were significantly juicier and more flavorful than the roasted chickens I've had in the past - plus the skin seems to be much crispier all the way around.
I feel that besides the crispier skin, one of the benefits of using a rotisserie is that the filling (herbs, garlic, etc - but specifically liquids like lemon) will coat the entire inside while the bird rotates, instead of just ""sitting still at the bottom"" during roasting.

Will flipping the chicken during roasting help with a more even crispy skin?
Will flipping the chicken affect/enhance the flavoring that comes from what I put inside the chicken?
If I should flip it, how often?

I should add that the chicken won't be sitting in liquid, I use a modified version of this recipe, which may make a difference when answering.
I am aware of this question about rotisserie beef, which is about why a rotisserie is better, but does not seem to address how one can get closer to a rotisserie style chicken in the oven.  Tim's answer is related, but assumes the chicken is sitting in liquid, and mine will not be.

what's a good technique for pasteurizing eggs?,"I tried to make homemade eggnog last Christmas. It turned out fine, but the eggs were an issue. I thought about buying pasteurized eggs but they would've run me $12 for two dozen, which seemed obscene. 
Pasteurization was important because my young child might have wanted some eggnog, so it needed to be very safe. 
So I pasteurized the eggs by heating them a little at a time in the microwave, stirring, heating etc until they reached 145F. I may have separated the yolks, but can't remember exactly. I read about the technique on a blog. This worked well enough, but I ended up with some chunks of cooked egg in the egg nog.

How could I use liquid flavorings to make a version of a jelly-topped cookie?,"I recently tried to make jelly-topped cookies (specific recipe was from home, but here's an example recipe) using an assortment of flavors, including maple syrup, homemade sumac syrup, homemade elderflower syrup, vanilla flavoring, and a pandan flavoring that I bought at my local Asian market. I thought I could just make a dent in the cookies and fill them directly with the flavorings; I was wrong. I sort of expected the liquids to cook off (which happened), but I thought they would at least leave flavor residues behind (that did not happen).
My goal is to be able to make small amounts of a bunch of different flavors and then use them to bake a single batch of cookies with a diversity of different jelly toppings. I already make homemade syrups for pancakes and marinades and the like; I'm not going to go through all the effort of making and storing dozens of different types of jellies too, not for just the occasional baking day.
So what is it about jelly that makes the flavors last better through the baking process? What would I have to do to a liquid flavoring to make it last through the baking process? If I made a paste out of flour and liquid flavoring, would that hold the flavor? Is gelatin important/useful in order to retain moisture? Any and all help appreciated!

What do I need to do to use my current recipe for thin-crust pizza?,"When I make pizza dough, I use a variation on Bobby Flay's recipe - instead of 3.5 - 4 cups of bread flour I use 2 cups of bread flour, 3/4 cup AP, and 3/4 cup white wheat, with maybe a touch more AP if the dough is too wet. I also use AP when kneading. This makes 2 ~14"" pizzas for me, which means a fairly thick crust - especially at the edges, which can get 1"" or higher after cooking.
I make 14"" pizzas largely because that's the size stone I have, but also because I can't get the dough to stretch much more without tearing. If I want to make slightly larger / thinner pizzas, do I need to modify the recipe? Is there a difference between thin-crust recipes and thick-crust recipes (and deep-dish)? Or is it a matter of technique before / while shaping the dough? Could I use this to make a truly thin crust pizza, or would I need an entirely different recipe?
Edit: The suggested duplicate is similar, but in my case the dough is able to be shaped exactly how the recipe indicates - yielding 2 ~14"" pizzas. I do not have problems working it to get the yield specified by the recipe, but am instead interested in using this same recipe to make more and/or bigger (thinner) pizzas.

"Should I get a thin, flat bottomed wok to stir fry large amounts of veggies on an electric stove?","Currently I stir fry veggies in a flat non-stick frying pan. It's OK but it doesn't have much volume so I can't cook a large amount of veggies unless I do so in batches, which I don't want to because I'm lazy. I want to throw in a bunch of veggies once, cook them, and be done. I understand that this may have a negative impact on flavour but I'm more interested in convenience.
To deal with this I want to get a wok, basically just to act as large frying pan. My first question is, will this be better than just using a big pot? My intuition is that the curved sides will mean more veggies touching lower, hotter parts of the container, and easier stirring. But maybe this is baloney.
I have an electric stove, and that's not going to change. So I'm going to get a flat-bottomed wok. My understanding is that the wok should get nice and hot and that this is more difficult on an electric stove. The woks I've seen have a wide variety of thicknesses. Should I be getting a really thin wok so that the wok heats up faster and transfers heat more quickly? Again, I'm primarily thinking of convenience. I don't want to stand around waiting for the wok to heat up. However I am fairly prone to burning the things I cook.
Similarly, should I aim for a wok made from a particular material?

Multi-nozzle piping rig?,"I need to frost a ton of cupcakes (hundreds) for an event in a few months and I'm looking for something to help me do this. Has anyone ever seen a manual multi-nozzle (like 3 or 4-nozzle) piping gun, or something like that? (Imagine 3 or 4 caulking guns side-by-side.)
This project is too big for a home kitchen and yet too small for large-scale commercial production.

UPDATE: The objective is to decorate 3-4 cupcakes at a time while keeping the piping tips handheld in order to allow for the finesse of hand piping. By multi-nozzle, I mean more like this or this rather than this. Only one frosting, no conveyor belt, and not this EZfrost gizmo. Almost thinking a 1:1 pantograph, but to output 3 or 4 finished products at a time. The nozzles could even be hoses coming from a single tube/tank to a bracket with 3-4 tips, remotely kinda sorta like this.
The mechanism could use piping bags or these fillable caulking tubes, just need to make sure they're food safe. And for the nozzle tips, it would need to accept either a standard large decorating tip coupler, or allow me to put the decorating tip on and secure it somehow.
OH, and I have access to a 3D printer! (I just don't know how to create the models.)
For a commercial kitchen, I'm willing to buy ingredients and do all the production there to preserve sanitation. For additional human labor, I had friends and family help me last year, and 26 hours later they all pretty much said they never want to see or hear about another cupcake again in their life... not sure I want to do that to them again.

How important is drying hands for sanitation?,"Several sites describing how to wash your hands list drying as the last step. Some say you can use a clean towel or air dry them.
I've been curious about something for a while. What if I'm preparing some ingredient or recipe that requires or benefits from having wet hands? For example, handling ground meat with wet hands reduces sticking; sometimes you want to use wet hands to handle dough, either to add more moisture or prevent sticking. What if I'm just picking up vegetables and sticking them back under the running water to rinse them before cutting and cooking or eating them raw?
Is it unsanitary wash hands and skip drying them before handling food items? What types of contaminants are especially risky when doing this?

"Am I still overcooking whitebait, how to prevent it?","I have had a problem where I am constantly overcooking whitebait.
In light of previous answers relating to the same issue, recently I have started to place the whitebait in the water, put a thermometer in the water and when the water reaches 45c, I just remove the pot from the stove.  This way, the water may at most rise up to 50c and the fish will end up being around that immersed in water.  Note I cant check the fish temperture(only the water) since the fish are too small and I believe most thermometers can't give an accurate read since they dont go deep enough into fish.
Unfortunately I notice that, despite my current method, saturated fat or liquid is relased from the fish into the water.  Fish releases its fat/juices at 55-60c so since my water is not at that temperature(i.e. it's at 45-50c at most) this should not be happening and hence there should be no fat/juice release\overcooking.
Can anyone think why this might be happening and how I can fix it?  My guess is that when cooking the temperature at the bottom of the pot is that hottest e.g. perhaps over 55c, this causes the bottom of the fish to overcook and go into the water.  
What do you think and how can I prevent this which for me is overcooking since I want the fish to be 55 at most i.e. fat should not break down or juices shouldnt release.

Why do you  slice whole ducks in half when roasting but not for other poultry?,"Last time I made a roast, I used a recipe from BBC good food. Since I have had luck with those recipes, I decided to go for their roast duck recipe.
That recipe involves cutting the whole duck in half and roasting the halves with the skin pointing up. I have never roasted a bird like that before, and I am wondering why someone would do it. Does it have to do with the flavor of the meat? Proportion of fat? I don't think I'd ever do that to a chicken because I'd be afraid the meat would go dry. But obviously the flavor of duck is different, and maybe if I know why people do that, I can use it intelligently in my cooking.

What are good counter-top oven settings to reheat french fries soggy from refrigerating overnight?,"I have yesterday's French Fries (Chips for those of you across the Pond). 
They were stored in a refrigerator overnight and now are cold AND soggy.
What's a good technique to reheat them in a small counter-top electrical oven? 
E.g. temperature? bake/broil/convection setting? How long?
Constraints:

I must heat them on a sheet of thin wrapping aluminum foil (over a loose grill, no tray)
I would prefer a method that takes less than 5 minutes, but that's not a cut-off
The main goal is to have them somewhat crispyish on the outside, and tasty (not hard, not soggy) on the inside
The fries/chips size can be either McDonalds size (1/2 cm^2 square cross cut) or slightly larger diner size (~0.5cm x 1 cm cross cut)
The amount is such that - evenly spreading them on an aluminum foil sheet the size of the oven's tray - they cover pretty much the whole sheet, in single layer
this is at work, so I am unlikely to have access to any ingredients (e.g. any answer that starts with ""sprinkle with xyz oil"" is less desirable. 

The fries are fully-cooked, from an order from an eatery, not home-cooked. So while I don't know the ingredients/coating/what they were fried in, a safe assumption is that the fries are either standard McDonalds recipe, or some sort of generic US Diner or midrange restaurant recipe, assuming one is known.

How to re-fold paper cupcake liners?,"Paper cupcake liners are made from circles of paper, then the outer parts are are crimped to create the (mostly) vertical sides. The shape of the liners should match the indentations in the muffin tin.
In my stash I found a few batches of liners that mysteriously got ""flattened"" a bit. Now when I place them on the tin, they don't sink to the bottom, but sit on top. If I simply push them down, on one or two places the pleats will fold towards the middle, getting enclosed by dough on both sides. Which isn't just aesthetically ""meh"", but also tears the cake when unwrapping.
Is there a reasonably easy way to get the liners back in shape?

I don't want to throw them away because they are really pretty.
But I don't want to spend hours to gently reshape them pleat by pleat either.
Sometimes filling the cups very slowly by piping the batter with a pastry bag while gently pushing the liners down and distributing the pleats helps a bit. But a fitting liner makes the work faster and easier.

Can I rest my Ciabatta dough overnight?,"I'm making Ciabatta for the first time Recipe (sorry, paywalled). My biga is fermenting as I type this, I'll mix the dough tomorrow. By then the biga will have had about a 16 hour ferment.
The dough will be difficult to handle. It's 80% hydration, and is described by America's Test Kitchen as being nearly pourable. The recipe calls for a mechanical mix and first knead, then two folding treatments* before baking. The folding is done with an oiled spatula, so I don't even need to touch the dough with my hands until it's time to shape the loaves. The shaping is shown in the video on the website (the paywalled link above) and it looks like it is going to be challenging. 
My experience with wet, difficult doughs is that they are much easier to deal with if allowed to rest in the refrigerator overnight, before the dough gets any time to rise. Since ciabatta dough is so wet, it seems a natural to me that an overnight rest would be a good idea but neither the recipe that I'm using, nor the dozen or so others I looked at mention a rest.
Is there something about ciabatta that makes is not a candidate for resting overnight?
I'm hoping for a nice chewy texture and a lot of holes in the crumb, like this:

I'll check answers and comments here before I commit, but since the recipe I'm using makes two loaves, I'm considering an experiment of doing one loaf as instructed by the recipe and allowing the other to rest in the refrigerator for 24 hours just after the first knead.

Crumbly cheddar,"I love cheddar cheese. One of my favorite types is Cabot Clothbound which is made by Jasper Hill Farm.
Usually when I get it, the cheese is nice and flaky, but other times it is crumbly. It seems to be a characteristic of the wheel; either the wheel is crumbly or flaky. I notice that the nice flaky wheels tend to have a rounder, more husky flavor, but the crumbly wheels are more cheddary and tart.
What is the reason for this? I have three possible theories:

Milk has seasonal differences, so cheddar made from spring milk, may
be different than cheddar made from autumn milk
The crumbly wheels are not being turned and fatted correctly. Cheddar
must be regularly turned and greased with lard, maybe this is not
happening on schedule.
Humidity is incorrect and the crumbly wheel is being allowed to dry
too much either because the aging cellar is too dry or because the
wheel is being stored outside the cellar in a dry place.

Does anyone have ideas as to the cause of the crumbly cheddar according to one of my theories or another theory altogether?

However, I don't know that I have found the optimal method for making the sauce at the end, despite all of that practice.  I've at different times thought that each of the following was correct:

Add the milk, then the powder, combine, then add softened butter 
Add the butter, mix thoroughly until melted, then the poweder, combine, then the milk
Add some milk, then the powder, then some more milk, then some more milk, then softened or melted butter
Remove the macaroni, just add butter to the warm pan (but not on the burner) until melted, add the powder, combine thoroughly, then the milk, then the macaroni (This is the ""Annie's"" box method)

Yet, I don't think ultimately it's ever really made a significant difference.  You always end up with a sauce that's so-so at first, a bit grainy and liquidy, and only after it's sat for a while (10-15 minutes) does it end up perfect - which for a 3 or 4 year old is eternity when faced with their favorite dish.

Why does frozen spinach have so much less iron than fresh spinach?,"I have been trying to increase my iron intake and was dismayed to learn that my frozen spinach only has 2% of my daily iron needs while fresh cooked spinach has about 20%. I have been under the impression that freezing vegetables preserves their nutrients from the moment they are picked/frozen and that transporting fresh vegetables across the country depletes the nutrients.
There was a whole about this some time ago either on TV or the internet or someplace.
So when I read the back of my frozen spinach container I was really surprised to find that it only has 2% of what I need.
Why is this? Is there a difference between the kinds of spinach that are grown for canning/fresh/frozen? Does freezing break something in the case of spinach? Does this happen with all fresh green leafy vegetables?

What Garlic to use for Garlic Bagels,"I have had great success making seeded bagels; I boil the bagels in water with baking soda and a little sugar, and any kind of seed sticks to the outside and bakes to perfection. My problem is trying to replicate garlic bagels.  Fresh garlic doesn't stick, and doesn't get dried out like I want.  Dehydrated ""garlic granules"" burn by the time the bagels are done.  So: 
What type of garlic works best for bagels? 
I am really looking for someone with actual experience making garlic bagels. 

Edited to respond to a comment: I can see the following problems with adding the garlic partway through baking.

(The main reason) The garlic will not stick to the outside of the bagel, since the bagel will be dry.  One would have to re-wet the bagel somehow, or maybe wet the garlic? 
Interrupting the baking process of bread is not good in my experience.  Since I cook bagels in six-bagel batches, the bagels would be out for a reasonable amount of time to add the garlic.  And re-moistening the surface would further cool them. 
It seems absolutely absurd to have to manipulate piping-hot bagels mid-bake just to add the topping. I am positive that this is not how the bagels I have in mind are made.  

However, if anyone has done it this way, let me know what your results were.

Why do I have lumps in my caramel? (NOT crystallized sugar.),"there are a lot of caramel questions. Hopefully I'm not repeating anyone...
I've made caramel sauce several times with the recipe from Sally's Baking Addiction. For some reason, though, whenever I make it I end up with lots of tiny lumps suspended in my caramel. As I mention in the title, these lumps are not little sugar crystals. I've had my caramel crystallize before, and this is very different. They're soft, for one thing, and so I'm not sure what's happening.
At first I thought the little lumps were just air bubbles. That's what they look like. But they actually have some body to them. It's almost like I have tiny bits of cooked egg or something (which is obviously impossible.) They have a gelatinous quality. So my guess is that the cream is doing something weird? Flavor is good, thickness is good, everything is good except these stupid little lumps.
Does anyone know what's happening, and how I can make it stop...? I'm about to take an immersion blender to the mess and let God sort it out.

It's the cornstarch in the powdered sugar -- wrong. Cornstarch doesn't have that cool taste, ... and the boxed powdered sugar also contains cornstarch anyway.
Some thermodynamic mumbo-jumbo about latent heat of crystalization, or enthalpy [?] when the sugar dissolves on your tongue, which may be true for all I know, but can't be the explanation since it would apply to all powdered sugar - or maybe even all sugar.

How do canned soup companies keep their noodles from absorbing all the liquid in the can?,"I like to make noodle soups.

cook the noodles separately and add to the soup when serving;
freeze the leftovers;
eat all the soup right away!

Squeezing as much liquid as possible out of a stock: a practical approach?,"When making stock at home (i.e. with a combination of chicken parts and vegetables), I am often at a loss for how to get the last bits of liquid out of the stock.

I'm making homestyle stock, so I'm not interested in coagulating proteins or making the stock as clear as possible (e.g. What's the best way to strain stock?) Instead, I'm interested in extracting every last bit of liquid for use later.
What's a practical way, using items that would normally be found in my kitchen, to squeeze my stock remnants as much as possible? I'm imagining something that actually resembles juicing a fruit. Currently I pour the stock into a colander and press on the top with a wide bowl, but I'm worried about breaking the colander and think I could do better.
Possible approaches I've considered, that aren't optimal:

Filling this 'milk bag' and twisting it. I'm be afraid of ripping the bag by twisting it too hard.

"Structure of tomato, ginger and garlic after blending in a blender","Found a new recipe, and it called for blending two (average sized) tomatoes, about a tablespoon of grated ginger (15 grams let's say), and four grated garlic cloves. Blended it all, everything fine.
When it was time to use the blended result, I expected it to come out of the blender jar like a (thick) liquid, but instead it just stayed in the jar. It actually acted liked beaten egg whites (clinging to the container), and structurally looked quite like a mousse. When I scooped out the ""mousse"", upon touching the heat of the pan, it dissolved immediately into liquid components again.
Is this a known property of blending tomato, ginger, garlic in a blender (or any ""high speed"" mixing device for that matter) together? Or a combination of those components?

If it helps, I used multiple smaller sized tomatoes to make up for one ""average"" tomato. So more tomato peel was involved, if that matters. Weights for the tomatoes were not given, but the replacements I used quite accurately match what I would consider ""An Average Tomato"".

Sous Vide Frustrations,"I recently purchased an Anova Precision Cooker circulator and have been unsuccessful in both attempts to cook meat using the sous vide technique, and I'd like to figure out why.
Attempt #1 - Ribeye Steaks
Setup
2 1.75"" thick ribeye steaks, salted, vacuum-sealed and in the bath for about 2 hours at 115 F - the meat was quite gray when it came out. I then finished with a sear on screaming hot cast iron, flipping once a minute and basting with a mixture of animal fats. After 5 minutes on the grill, I started using a Thermapen to probe the internal temperature
Result
There was quite a bit of banding and the center of the meat turned out to be closer to medium than medium rare. I've since learned salting before is a bad idea when using sous vide, and these particular ribeye cuts were relatively poor quality.
Attempt 2 - Pub-Style burgers
Setup
2 3/4"" thick burger patties made from 1 lb of food-processed sirloin steak. The patties contained melted butter and pepper (not salt), were ziploc bag-sealed, and left in a 133 F water bath for 50 minutes. They were then finished in a very hot stainless steel pan and bacon fat, about 1 minute (perhaps a bit more) on each side.
Result
Awful - completely dry and lacking flavor. One of the patties happened to break up slightly when removing it from the ziploc bags and I noticed it was completely gray throughout. The burger that remained intact also turned out entirely gray.
I tend to favor the reverse-sear method for cooking meat, and have successfully cooked both of the above recipes many times by starting the meat in a 225 F oven, raising its internal temperature to 115 F, and finishing with a sear and frequent flipping until medium rare is achieved. So far, sous vide has failed to replace my favored approach, and I don't understand why.
What I've tested
- The Anova is working correctly, verified the same temperature as measured by my Thermapen in an empty pot of water.
- The burgers were not salted, so no more moisture was pulled out than necessary.
Unknowns
- The bags tend to move around quite a bit and one of them usually winds up wedged against the Anova. Could this inadvertently cause the circulator to have a false reading? I didn't test the water temperature during the cook, but I was able to put my hand in the water for a few seconds before it started to hurt.
- What's the recommended size for a pot of water? I'm using what I thought was a good-sized stock pot (at least 2 gallons).

Brown Basmati rice -- How to prevent mushiness?,"I have been cooking regular white Basmati for years and have perfected the method to get it to perfection (solid, tender, not mushy). 
Recently, I decided to try brown Basmati because I heard brown rice is healthier.  I first tried cooking it the same exact way as white but, once the water was all evaporated, I realized the rice was still really hard and needed to cook more, so I added more water.  After the second addition, the rice was alright but also turned mushy and grains stuck to one another.  I think it takes 50% more water to cook than white Basmati.
Typically, what I do with white is I bring 3.5 coffee mugs of water to a boil with 1.5 tsp of salt and some oil to prevent sticking to the pot.  Note I am not using a rice cooker.  Then I add 1.5 coffee mugs of rice and reduce the fire just down to where only very small 2-3 bubbles are coming at a time.  That gets my white Basmati to perfection.  I used 5 mugs of water with brown rice, the rice finally got necessary tenderness but also was mushy.
I understand that  brown rice is much better for you but the biggest reason I am so much in love with Basmati is the texture, long grain and being able to cook it yet each grain can be separated.  If I can't learn to cook brown Basmati like that, I might just go back to white.

What determines if the handle of a pan gets hot while in use?,"About three years ago, we replaced a one 10"" skillet with another, both Macy's Tools of the Trade anodized aluminum teflon skillets. (The teflon coating didn't last on the old pan.)

Sushi/nori/yaki paper - out of date?,"I make a lot of sushi.  But, as I buy the paper/wrapper in 100's, sometimes I do not use it in what might be considered good time.  I have searched and searched the packet for a sell or eat by date but there is none.  Is this OK to use even though I bought it about 8 months ago, and opened it about 6 months ago.  I have made sushi today from it, it seems OK, rolled great and cut brilliantly, but should I be concerned?  The paper is not too dry on the edges and is still a great greeny/blackish color.

How to prolong the life of chillies in a refrigerator?,"Last week I bought a packet of green chilli from an Asian store, the really hot ones. I only used 5 of those and had about 20-25 still left in the little plastic bag (with holes). I just kept it refrigerated but within 4 days, there was mold growing on the stem of the chillies. So, I took the stem off and froze the rest. But then I read that the chilli goes mushy in the freezer.
What can I do to prolong the shelf life of chilli so they stay fresh for longer in the refrigerator (but not frozen)?

What difference would using Rock Sugar make in tea?,"I like my tea sweet, and generally add several cubes of white sugar. Teavana sells rock sugar, which it claims is somehow ""better"" while being vague on what that means. Is it sweeter? Less sweet? Somehow interacts with the tea leaves differently? 
Interesting, you're meant to brew it with the leaves, presumably sweetening the whole pot rather than doing it to taste for individuals, which sounds annoying. Is that just marketing or does that have some benefit?

Slow cooker lid gasket smell,"I bought a Hamilton Beach slow cooker a while ago. I never had success with it since all the stuff that I made didn't smell good. I finally figured out that it was the rubber gasket on the lid that smelled bad. I don't know if the smell was concentrated food aroma or burnt rubber. I soaked the lid in vinegar overnight and then rinsed it. The smell was gone. I then made some pinto beans in the slow cooker and the gasket again stinks, this time similar to a very very stron pinto bean smell. I am thinking of either giving up on slow cooking or buying a crock pot brand. My questions:

Is the extremely strong smell from the rubber gasket a common occurrence in slow cookers in general?
If not, I guess I should just go and buy a different brand/model and shouldn't have this problem.
If they are, are there any gasketless slow cookers or lids that would solve this problem?
Does overcooking tend to bring out different, or offensive smells from otherwise normal food and sauces?

How do I maximize the shelf life of my homemade hot sauce?,"I am planning on putting this year's crop of hot peppers to use by trying my hand at making my own hot sauces.
I've never tried this before, but I've found a number of recipes on the Internet.  However, I'm concerned about shelf life, and the variations in preparation methods that I'm seeing in the recipes are a bit confusing.
Some of the recipes simply call for mixing the peppers, some other vegetables (typically carrots, onions or bell peppers), seasoning (such as sugar or garlic) and vinegar.  The mixture is then blended in a food processor, and is ""ready to eat"" with no cooking.
Others call for simmering the ingredients in vinegar prior to putting them in the food processor.
Yet others actually detail month-long fermentation processes.
Some of the recipes say the resulting sauce will last at least for a year.  Others say a month or two.
Since the sauces will be too hot for anyone in the house but myself to use, I would prefer to extend the shelf life as long as possible.  If it goes bad in a month, I'll wind up throwing away a ton.
What is the basic method I should use to maximize the shelf life of a combination of hot peppers (bhut jolokia or ghost peppers, if that matters), carrots, garlic, and possibly bell peppers, apples, or grapes (all alternative ingredients I am interested in experimenting with)?

Liquid underneath clotted cream,"TL;DR Why do I find liquid at the bottom of the pan when I make clotted cream?
I've read about clotted cream in books all my life, but it wasn't a thing where I grew up. I recently discovered this recipe online and have tried it out a few times. I follow the directions exactly:

Set convection oven to about 170º or 175º F 
Pour cream into clear Pyrex baking dish to about 1"" thickness
Put dish in oven and let it remain there for at least 8 hours 
Remove dish from oven and let cool for 15 minutes
Refrigerate for 5 or 6 hours.

Each time, I have the same issue. The top layer of the result looks just like in the video, but the buttery portion goes only about three-quarters of the way down the baking dish. The rest is just liquid. In the video, when Steve scoops out the cream at 4:27, it is obvious that there is no liquid at the base. 
What accounts for this difference? I have three theories, but don't know whether any of them is correct:

Steve says to use ""fresh cream"". Does that mean unpasteurized? Raw cream, as it's called here, is super expensive and only semi-legal to buy. So I have to buy pasteurized. I've used both UHT and non-UHT pasteurized cream, and have seen the same results from both. Is it possible that using pasteurized cream causes there to be liquid?
Steve also says to use the ""thick cream that we would use for whipping up"", which according to Wikipedia means cream that is about 35% milkfat, in UK usage. I used heavy cream, which is 36% milkfat in US usage. So I think I'm using the correct equivalent of what Steve says to use, but perhaps I'm using the wrong kind of cream?
Is my oven temperature wrong somehow? I thought perhaps the milkfat was rising to the top too rapidly and then forming a thick seal that prevented the cream at the bottom from separating. Is this a possibility, and if so, how can I fix it?

I'm attaching two pictures. The first shows the liquid after I've removed a small portion of the clotted cream from the top. 

The second shows the liquid by itself, poured out into a jar. 

From reading this other question, it seems that whey accumulates at the bottom of clotted cream. But I don't see any liquid at all in the video. And besides, the liquid I have does not correspond to my idea of whey. It's still somewhat viscous and yellow, and lacks the grey, transparent thinness of the whey I get from yogurt. 
I thought that it might be buttermilk that remains after the milkfat separates, but it also seems too thick to be buttermilk. I put a dash of it in the scrambled eggs I was making to go with the bread I baked to go with the clotted cream, and the eggs were fine. I've previously used it instead of whey or water to bake bread, but it turned the bread somewhat gummy. So what is this liquid anyway?
Oh by the way, the semisolid stuff above the liquid layer is very tasty, but since I've never had any other clotted cream, I don't know whether it is the taste it's supposed to be.

What is ideal temperature for baking cupcakes?,"I baked two batches of cupcakes at 180˚C but both collapsed in the middle.

"Baking frozen cod and rice with carrots, can it work?","This is a dish that I'm trying to figure out. Out of laziness I want to cook a whole meal that includes some veggies, protein and carbs in a single baking.
I don't thaw the cod before because it's usually a dish that I make with no preparation.
I mix diced carrots and rice with oil, salt, pepper, and some spices like rosemary, sage and thyme. Then put the mixture in an over tray add the frozen cod and enough stock for the rice to cook in.
Finally it goes in the oven at ~180*C (~370*F) until the rice is done. 
The result is reasonably good, with flavors from the fish and the carrots blending into the rice, but overall a bit underwhelming.
Any suggestions on what could be improved? Is there some other all-in-one-tray baking recipe I could use?
I'd like to stay away from garlic or onions, but maybe there are other herbs or spices that would work better with the stock and rice rather than the ones I'm using?
I guess I'm wondering which spices are at their best when cooked in lots of water and go well with fish.
The carrots cook well, but they don't really brown, some on top just dry up and others are close to boiled, would lowering the cooking temperature help?
Other vegetables that would work better here instead?

Can I season a stainless steel frying pan?,"After the advice I gave about seasoning a cast iron pan,  one would think I knew. I don't though. I have 2 large cast iron pans I use regularly but I'd love my good quality small stainless steel pan to have the same hard lasting seasoned non-stick coating my iron pans have. I've injured my wrists many years back so I'd like a pan that's easy to move without the strain. I don't want to use anything like spray Pam either.
Considering how seasoning works, it sounds do-able except for one problem. The top layer of a cast iron pan isn't completely smooth but slightly porous. That's why an oil film is able to initially stick to the pan. I'm not sure a stainless steel pan's surface is porous. 
The way most people think of a new stainless pan being seasoned in preparation for use isn't what I mean. That's not a long lasting finish. I want the tough finish you get seasoning a cast iron pan by multiple oiling, heating and cooling. So has anyone tried and if so, what were your results?

(Is it safe?) Preparing Breakfast in Bulk,"Seasoned Advice-Givers,
I make an excellent breakfast, but would like to prepare a 7-day supply in bulk, to eliminate the preparation time I expend every weeknight.
The ingredients are:

3 Cups Rolled Oats
Large handful of Sultanas
Large handful of Dates
3.5 whole bananas, thinly sliced
Enough milk to completely submerge all ingredients in a sealed, air-tight mixing bowl

I'm reasonably confident about how well the sultanas/dates/oats will hold up, as far as food safety goes. (If I'm wrong, I'll know in about a day or so). BUT, I'm a little worried about putting the bananas into the mixture. 
Obviously, bananas are quite perishable, once peeled, but what if submerged entirely in milk, mixed with the other ingredients, in an air-tight, sealed mixing bowl? Will they go rotten rather quickly, or will the described environment preserve them?
Keep in mind, I do not mind mushy, rich, super-soft bananas that have started to turn - I think these are quite flavourful. But I don't want to cross the line into sanitarily dangerous. 
I know I can get at least 1 day without them spoiling, but I'm aiming for closer to 7 - It is likely the bananas in the mixture would still be safe to eat by Day 7? If not, at how many days do you recommend that I should draw the line?
This would be stored in the fridge, top-shelf toward the back, which is the coldest part. Fridge set to a 4 out of 7 on the temperature dial, which is one notch before ice will form on water.

How much acid to use for stabilizing meringue?,"After reading up on the proper books, I started adding some acid when beating meringues. At home, I use cream of tartar, but when I am baking at somebody else's kitchen, I am lucky if they have at least some citric acid; cream of tartar is a huge rarity here. 
The trouble is that the books don't specify a ratio. They speak of throwing in ""a pinch"", suggesting that the exact amount is not that important. In my experience, this is not true. 
I have had meringues fail despite cream of tartar. They went from a runny mess to an overtightened stiff layer floating on water without a noticeable sweet spot inbetween. I admit that I may have used the wrong whipping speed (this happens especially often when I whip by hand), but 1) I can't attribute it to speed alone, and 2) this is exactly the kind of problem I hope the acid works against. 
Then again, I have whipped beautiful meringues with acid. Cream of tartar helps there too, but citric acid frequently gives me a great texture from a single pinch (maybe 1.5 g) per 2-3 eggwhites. The meringue gets smooth and glossy, with robust little bubbles, and holds without deflating when folded into other ingredients, even during a not-so-gentle macaronage. The problem: at this concentration, the sour taste is already very noticeable. In some very sweet applications, this still works, but most times it adulterates the taste. 
So, what is the minimal ratio at which acid works (given a sensible technique - forget hand whipping for now?) And what is the maximum ratio at which acid is still undetectable in taste? I am interested in both cream of tartar and citric acid here.

I tried using both butter and (canola) oil in the pan to avoid sticking, and in varying quantities, cleaning the pan after each failed attempt (so there isn't any burnt stuff from the previous attempt to cause issues), and varying the amount of milk/flour in the batter
Was there something else I should have tried, or was it a hopeless endeavor to being with?

Will a hot cornstarch slurry added to a cold mixture still have a thickening effect?,"I'm trying to thicken a heat-sensitive mixture. I would like to use cornstarch as a thickener, but from my understanding, cornstarch must be heated to near-boiling (95 deg C) to gel in a mixture.

If I make a cornstarch slurry, heat it to boiling, and then add it to a cold or room-temperature mixture, will it still have a thickening effect?

How to make double cream 48% for tart filling (not for whipping)?,"In my country it is impossible to get double cream (48% fat). The highest fat content I can get is 35% whipping cream. I have some recipes which require double cream and I don't want to substitute it with 35%.

"Old, unpasteurized orange juice has extra tang","I've been buying unpasteurized orange juice recently for its richer flavor, as compared to pasteurized OJ.  I've had some sitting in the fridge for about a week, and upon tasting it just now I noticed an extra tang that I'm pretty sure was not there when I first bought it.  I presume this is due to some new acid in the juice that has formed from the breakdown of other components of the juice as it aged.  I quite like this additional complexity of the flavor, but I am curious: What is it?  In particular, what acid might I be tasting?

Removing that eggy smell from cakes,"I've been baking for not that long now and I usually peruse the web and the hundreds of books I have at home before I attempt a recipe. However there is one thing I am just not able to get down right. 
Whenever a cake or something involving eggs is baked, I get a really strong eggy smell that puts me off. Even after it has cooled down, the egg smell and taste remains. But I don't notice this in cakes from stores or bakeries. I don't know what to do to neutralize this, or is it completely normal?
I use brown farm fresh eggs that aren't pumped full of stuff (at least that's what they say on the packaging).
Update: I will try to figure out what the cheap eggs taste like in the next cake that i bake. Furthermore, i will also compare with results i obtain from a new professional line oven that i am purchasing soon. One of these is the culprit, since whenever i eat baked goods elsewhere this issue is rarely experienced.

There is a substantial difference between the 2 and we apparently do not like white pepper

(Intentionally) Mixed Texture 'Scrambled Eggs',"I'm trying to replicate a strange form of 'scrambled eggs' that I had on holiday in Austria recently, but I can't figure out how it's done.
Instead of the usual fluffy, semi-soft yellow 'clouds', all roughly the same texture, this was a mix of different textures/types: part slightly runny omelette, part firmer omelette, part hard boiled egg including the whites. I thought the omelette parts and the boiled egg parts must have been cooked separately then assembled at the end, but the finished article was all joined/melded together rather than being in separate pieces.
I've tried making the different components separately then combining, but it doesn't all come together right at the end. I've also tried poaching the eggs, then putting them in a frying pan, bursting the yolks and letting the liquid form the omelette, but again that doesn't come out right. 
PS: Two points to add:
1) I had this several times while on holiday and it was always the same, so I presume it was intentional and not a 'one off' mistake by the chef.
2) I know it probably seems like more trouble than it's worth, but I really enjoyed the mix of textures rather than the usual homogenous variety, so it's not about replicating it for the challenge. I really want to keep eating this!
Does anyone have any ideas please?
Thanks in advance.

Hard dry crusts on frozen bread,"I have always frozen my bread with no noticeable difference. Some fridge freezers seem to impart a stale freezer burn flavor to lots of things, but I've never had that issue. I'm guessing it has to do with the freshness/cleanliness of the freezer, how things are packaged, how long they are frozen, etc.  
I'm having suddenly having issues with the crust, sometimes just part of the crust, becoming extremely hard and tough on store-bought sliced bread that is usually frozen no more than 3 weeks.
The only variable that has changed is the style of deep freeze--we just received an upright, self-defrosting freezer, replacing our very old deep chest freezer that was not self-defrosting.  Perhaps the newer one is removing more moisture from the air in the freezer, hence drying the bread.  That makes sense, however, I used to freeze bread in my refrigerator freezer, which is also self-defrosting, with no issues.
I've tested lowering the temp of the freezer, and storing the bread on the shelf instead of in the door. Neither have made a difference.  I'm planning to get a plastic tote with lid thinking that might help reduce drying air exposure.
Perhaps my question is more related to the functionality of this freezer, manufacturer's performance issue, or simply a variability in freezer styles. I just find it odd that after freezing food for 40 years with no issues, this has suddenly become a problem.

How to go about reducing sugar in a butter cake recipe?,"Recently I made some cupcakes that turned out mostly great. However, even other people than me – I have an aversion towards overly ""sugary"" desserts – said they were fairly sweet, and for me it seemed to obscure the other flavors. 
(The other flavours being vanilla or rose in the batter. You could certainly smell them so I don't think it was just that they evaporated while baking, and I use a fairly heavy hand with those ingredients for baked goods.)
Is there any rule-of-thumb on what the ""correct"" ratio of sugar to other ingredients in a cake recipe is so I could tell if the recipe was using too much? (The recipe was: cream butter and sugar, add flour and baking powder, add eggs, add milk, stir until just combined, bake.) Or how far I could reduce sugar from the standard recipe without negatively affecting texture / moisture? And is it necessary to adjust any of the other ingredient amounts along with the sugar?

How to bake a chicken?,"I've been using a rotisserie oven to bake my chickens for a while now. However, it's no longer available to me.
My first attempt at baking a chicken in a long time:
Purchase a chicken that's approximately 5 LBS.
Removed the innards of the chicken and washed it.
Marinaded the chicken with Johnny's Seasoning.
Place the chicken on a deep baking tray, resting on a grill.
Let the chicken sit for 2 hours at room temperature.
Baked the chicken at preheated 400 degrees on middle rack for 1:20:00.
Allow the chicken to sit for 20 minutes, then cut it into pieces for consumption.

My results: The chicken was nearly done, but one thigh was a little bloody at the joint.  The other was very bloody at the joint.  I microwaved the bloodier pieces and ate them anyway. The rest of the chicken was cooked pretty well.
My questions: How can I improve upon my process?  Should I be baking the chicken at a lower temperature (350 degrees) for longer?  Should I be baking at 400 degrees for longer?  Should I raise the temperature to 425 degrees?
I've considered using a meat thermometer, but it seems daunting to me and I haven't had a lot of lucky in the past. Maybe my thermometer is just bad?

Identify this dessert,"One of the best desserts I've ever tasted came from a restaurant which no longer exists, and I am trying to identify what it might be called and how to prepare it myself.  It looked sort of like a colorful flan--pie shaped with about four fruit-based layers stacked on top of each other.  I would call it a tart, but it had no crust.  The bottom layer was quite thin (maybe .5 cm) and contained passion fruit and probably some lime juice, and it was about the most delicious thing I've ever had.  
So the questions are: 

What should I call such a dessert?
Can someone suggest a recipe for the fruit layers (especially the passion fruit layer)?  The layers were stiff enough to stand on their own, but soft enough to be cut with a fork.


Edit: In response to comments:

The texture and consistency was about like a brownie---but maybe slightly softer and smoother.  There were no chunks or slices of fruit visible.
I don't know other flavors specifically, but I'm pretty sure there was a berry layer (raspberry maybe?).  Lemon might have been another.  The flavors were not declared explicitly on the menu, and the only reason I know that passion fruit was in the dessert is that I was so impressed I asked the server what the flavor of the bottom layer was. 
It was served at close to room temperature, maybe slightly chilled. 
I would describe the restaurant as ""trendy modern cuisine"".  It was in a mountain resort area, and typical plates ran $20-$30.  I think the main dish I had that evening was pan-seared medallions.

Include salt in dry premix?,"Should salt be part of the dry premix? I plan to start making dry premixes, as normally done in factory operations. Separated for different pastries, the premixes will include any of the ff: flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and cocoa powder. My question is, can salt be part of a premix, or should I reserve it for the wet mix on the day of dough-preparation?
Reason I ask is because the original recipe for cookies that I used, instructed to mix in salt with the dry ingredients. However, knowing that salt is a polar compound, I figured it might fare better by being homogenous with the eggs, butter, and sugar. On the other hand, by mixing salt with the dry ingredients, I know that it would already be set and I won't have to worry about forgetting to put salt in my batter.

Method for including bacon in an otherwise vegan chili?,"So I've got a vegan chili I make on a regular basis that I think is pretty darn good, but I'm always looking for ways to make it better. (I'm not actually vegan. Obviously.) Last time I included bacon and bourbon but the effect was... not what I had hoped. The bacon became very soggy and the bacon flavor was non-existent. (So was the bourbon flavor, but that's neither here nor there.)
Here's my current method for the chili in broad strokes (makes about 10 cups):

Saute onions, peppers (as well as the chili peppers), and cumin
seeds in some oil until onion is translucent
Dump in beans, tomatoes, liquids (usually beer + veggie broth), and spices
Pressure cook in the instant pot for ~6 mins
Add some tomato paste and then simmer to reduce for 30-60 mins until desired thickness

My first attempt at this was just throwing in 3-4 slices of already-cooked, chopped up bacon in during step 2, but clearly that didn't work so well.
How can I get this to go better so I have a present-but-not-overpowering bacon flavor without gross floppy bits of bacon everywhere?

What is the effect of adding eggs to a pastry dough?,"As I understand it, making dough is really the process of hydrating flour so that a gluten network can be formed and the dough structure emerges.
Pastry dough usually adds butter in order both to reduce the amount of gluten formed and also to interleave sheets of fat to sheets of gluten to make it crumbly and oh so good.
What I don't understand is what eggs do to the dough. Most American apple pie recipes use no eggs for their dough, but almost all italian pastry dough (pastafrolla) use an abudance of eggs in lieu of some water.
What do these eggs do to the flour/butter mix?  Do they increase gluten formation or decrease it, or no effect at all?

Sous vide over cooking toughens meat?,"I'm new to sous vide cooking.  The equipment I'm using is a Ronson slow cooker
connected to Sous Vide Magic PID controller, no bubbler.  No vacuum sealer.
I calibrated the SVM temperature reading to boiling water, and it was very
close (99.9 oC).  I then ""auto-tuned"" the PID.  The end result is that it
takes a long time to get up to temperature (/slow/ cooker), but holds it
within 0.1 oC once achieved consistently.
For my first experiment I wanted to try Douglas Baldwin's Flat Iron Steak
recipe. (12hr @ 55 oC)
I chose three well marbled blade steaks (cheap cut) with a little bit of bone
in the centre.  Each steak was individually sealed in a zip-lock bag using the
water submerge method Doublas Baldwin recommends.
The first day I cooked them for 10 hours (not 12, it was dinner time, and I was
impatient :( ).  I quickly seared the steak 30 seconds per side in a very hot
pan and rested it for 3 minutes before serving.  It was very tender and had a
beefier flavour than any other steak I can remember.  But there were some
tougher bits around the sinew, but still edible.
I left the other two pieces in the fridge over night and continued cooking one
of them for 10 hours the next day.  To my surprise after 20hr total of cooking
at 55 oC, this piece felt tougher and more rubbery than the first, and the
sinewy bits were distinctly even tougher.  Does anyone have an explanation for
this?
I know thickness in a slab shaped piece of meat is most crucial in determining
cooking time, and each of these steaks was about 15mm thick (so not very
thick), so potentially even 10hr was too long?

What is the difference in method between French and Italian macarons?,"According to this question, there are two different forms of macarons, ""French"" and ""Italian"". What is the difference between the French and Italian macaron method - and where does the name originate?
I'm guessing it has something to do with how the meringue is made as I've seen some recipes that use the Italian meringue method (hot sugar syrup) as opposed to a method that uses solid sugar.
Are both methods really still ""French"" regardless of the name? I ask because a book I'm reading is very obviously written by a French man (apparently the ""king of French pastry"" but he uses the method with the Italian meringue and doesn't call his macarons ""Italian macarons"". In fact, I'm pretty sure he refers to them as ""French macarons"".

As a note, I don't believe this to be a duplicate of the linked question as that is asking for differences in the results. I'm asking about differences in the actual method itself.

How can I tell when the wax has been removed from citrus fruit?,"This evening I tried different ways (taken from other cooking forums) of removing the wax coating from lemons.

Pouring boiling water over
In a bowl with (initially) boiling water for five minutes
Scrubbing with warm water and dishwashing liquid
Scrubbing with warm water and ascorbic acid
Scrubbing with warm water and baking soda. 

After each trial I rubbed the lemons with a tea cloth. The methods involving boiling water produced slightly tacky, but less glossy lemons. The other methods made no obvious difference. No method really impressed me, and in the end I couldn't say if one method was better than another.
Before I experiment further, I would like to find a more objective technique for judging the results.
Some methods left the lemons looking as glossy as they were to begin with. Other methods left the skin feeling slightly tacky. Neither of these outcomes seems right to me, although I'm hampered by the fact that I live in a country where you don't see many lemon trees. I'm not quite sure how an unwaxed lemon looks and feels.

Why shallots over onions?,"It seems that in more advanced cookbooks and when watching professional chefs that shallots are used extensively. They seem to be used in the places where onions are in cookbooks which are aimed at home cooks.
I am familiar with the genetic similarities between onions and shallots. I have not personally cooked with shallots because they cost an order of magnitude more than onions.
If it is not just my misperception that shallots are preferred- what qualities do shallots have that make them more popular than onions?
Should I expect shallots to be much more expensive than onions or am I shopping at the wrong places?
In short- are they worth paying more for?

UK versus US expiration dates on diet sodas,"I took a trip to the UK last week, and as an avid Coke Zero drinker, was surprised to find that my Coke Zero supposedly expired in March 2016 in most places I went.
Surprised, because in the US, diet sodas are typically dated 3-4 months from production, and actually do taste noticeably less sweet at that point (to the point that some brands of soda, including Coke Zero, are undrinkable for me if they're at the expiration date).  March 2016, even assuming they were produced next door and stocked that day, was almost 6 months out, and considering about 75% of the sodas I found were that date (I did see some Jan and Dec, but almost all Mar) it sounds like they're dated at least six months out.  But even the Dec dated sodas tasted fine (Which, if they were 3 months old, would start tasting off to me normally in the US).
Why is that? Does the UK have different regulations, or are there different formulas that explain it, or different storage, or ... something else?  The base sweeteners were the same (Aspartame and Ace-K), though of course it's impossible to tell %s in the US so who knows if they're the same; and I think it all tasted differently there than in the US, so it's hard to say if there's more/less in there.

"Is there such thing as ""active dry sourdough-variety yeast""?","Apologies in advance if this is a stupid question, or if it doesn't sound coherent, but: Is it possible to buy sourdough yeast, ready to use? 
You can easily find ""active dry yeast"" for sale in supermarkets. I realize this regular bread yeast is a different variety from your typical sourdough yeast. 
But can the sourdough type of yeast (I guess it is referred to as ""wild yeast""?) be packaged in a way that you can just add it to your dough whenever you feel like baking, and not have to maintain a starter in a special container, with all the fussy feeding rituals, and worries about its health and environmental conditions, etc.? ... I imagine taking care of the starter must be half the fun, but people are always trying to make a buck by selling you convenience, so I wonder if you can buy little packets of ""active dry sourdough yeast"". 
Or does wild yeast have some characteristic that makes it impossible to package it up neatly for sale? Or is there some other reason I haven't seen this product, even on the internet? ... Or do I just need to open my eyes, and I will see it in every market?

Partially tough pulled pork after 12 hours,"So, after grilling a half picnic roast of pork (about 5lbs) for around 12 hours at about 200 - 250 (F) I found half of the final product to be tender and half tough. I sprinkled it with salt the night before, and then put on a dry rub over a splash of water a few minutes before it went onto the grill. I had planned to keep it on the grill (propane) until the internal temperature to had risen to about 200.  10 hours into the cook I kicked the temp up to about 300.  The internal temp was about 192 when I took it off.
In the end, a large part of the roast pulled apart nicely like I expected, but some sections would not and seemed to be very dry. Only about half of the final pulled pork was edible.
I was monitoring the temperature with a dual probe thermometer, one probe in the meat and one in the nearby grill air. Unfortunately due to lax attention and some shifting weather that day, the grill temp did drop below 200 several times during the day, once for over an hour (I know thanks to the fancy history chart in my thermometer).  The internal temp stalled at about 140 for over an hour but for the most part it was progressing nicely.
Did I overcook this by letting the grill run too cool for too long?  Or was it from spiking the temp to 300 at the end?

Using acidity to brighten simple sides like purees,"I made a simple carrot puree last night doing the following:

Sweat off some carrots, onions, garlic and a bit of peeled apple
Added a small amount of apple cider vinegar
Added a bit of an alcoholic cider along with some water as a ""stock"" and simmered until soft. The alcoholic cider was a bit of an experiment.

Once blended, I noticed the puree was quite sweet (cider added a lot of sweetness along with the carrots), so I added a touch more apple cider vinegar to try balance and brighten things, especially considering the puree was a side to quite a rich protein.
The result was OK but not really what I wanted...I found the vinegar acidity did balance and lift the dish a bit, but I also found myself tasting the vinegar a bit too much. I wanted the acidity & brightness without actually tasting the apple cider vinegar.
I was left wondering if I should've rather added more cider vinegar earlier and let it cook through, or maybe just use less..or even just use a different type of vinegar?

How can I improve a dish with badly cooked spices without recooking?,"I am living in a place where the food (namely curries) served is so bad I lose my appetite by just smelling it. I've tried making it taste better by adding some chilli powder, salt, and onions but it hasn't helped.

I asked my friend why is the food tastes bad, and he said that spices need to be cooked to release the flavours and the person making the dish is not cooking them properly so the raw spices are causing a bad taste.
So is cooking necessary for all spices to release flavour? How can I tell whether that's the problem, and how can I improve a dish with badly cooked spices without recooking?

Sodastream loses carbonation when adding syrup,"I have a sodastream, and for the most part it makes great carbonated water. However, any time I try to use the flavoring syrups, my drink becomes completely flat. I do follow the instructions and only carbonate water (no pumping bubbles with the syrup already mixed in).
I've tried all techniques I could think of: stirring syrup into fizzy water, pouring fizzy water over syrup, pumping syrup into fizzy water without mixing. Basically, if I don't stir, all the syrup goes to the bottom of the glass, and if I do stir, the bubbles are gone. I've tried refrigerating the syrup, room temp, warming it. The best technique I have come up with so far is to add a little bit of carbonated water, pour in the syrup, mix that up, and then add the rest of the carbonated water. I like to believe this ""loosens"" the syrup so it mixes into cold water a bit better. However, even with this technique, the drink is flat.

How do I choose frozen fish so that it doesn't release so much water?,"I bought a package of frozen, individually wrapped, vacuum-sealed pacific cod fillets (about 150-200 grams each) from what I thought was a reputable brand (and not the lowest price) in my nearest supermarket, and attempted to pan-fry it. I defrosted it by running cold water in the sink as advised in this answer (it took about 15 minutes). When I opened the package, a large amount of water had separated from the fish. I carefully dried the fillet with towel paper, coated it with flour and put it in a hot pan over maximal heat as explained in this other question. Despite my efforts and the hot pan, the fish immediately started releasing even more water, dissolving the flour and turning into a small 75-100 grams of boiled, chewy fish fillet instead of a nice fried, tender one.
So I am looking for advice on how to properly choose frozen fish in the first place. I know that it should be properly vacuum-sealed and from a reputable source (whatever that means). But even then, some frozen fishes will loose a lot of water (it was obviously the case here). What qualities should I look for when buying it? Can I tell by the fish aspect or something else if it's good or not? Are some species better than others?

Is my heavy cream not actually heavy cream?,"I am under the impression that the difference between milk and heavy cream is the percentage of butterfat/milkfat. I purchased a gallon of D enriched whole milk today, as well as some heavy ""whipping"" cream. 
The heavy whipping cream lists Serving Size as 1 Tablespoon, Total Fat at 5g: 8%, Saturated Fat at 3.5g: 17%, and Monounsaturated Fat at 1.5g (with no percentage).
The whole milk lists Serving Size as 1 Cup, Total Fat at 8g: 12%, Saturated Fat at 5g: 25%, and does not list Monounsaturated Fat.
I believe that g = grams.
The Heavy Cream that I purchased is the only heavy cream available at the local store where I generally do my shopping.

Turkey vs Chicken broth,"I've tried to research this but can't find much on it.  Most explanations don't really address what I am seeing in my soup pot each time I boil up a used bird.  These are already cooked birds and are the leftovers from roasted turkeys or chickens. I love a pure broth for lunch.  I am also a great believer in 'Jewish Penicillin**, thus lots of chicken broth.  I use the broth for soup stock also.

Why is turkey broth always cloudy whitish and chicken broth clearer or brownish? It doesn't seem to be the fat content of the bird or broth. This almost always happens when I use the carcasses from either fowl to make broth.  It doesn't seem to be dependent on how I cooked either bird.

update: I was trying to not explain the health side of things, but as most people aren't familiar with Wilson's Disease (I wasn't until a couple of months ago; and it's not Wilson's Syndrome): the issue is your body absorbing too much copper, which causes liver failure (and then death).  I didn't ask specifically about 'low copper diets', because although a low copper diet is part of the treatment (<1mg/day initially, so about 50% of the US FDA Daily Recommended Value), you also have to avoid anything else that would stress the liver (so alcohol is out)

Having trouble with the sweet & sour sauce recipe,"Recipe here: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/19670/sweet-and-sour-sauce-i/
Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup white vinegar
2/3 cup water
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon ketchup
2 tablespoons cornstarch

Directions:
Place the sugar, vinegar, water, soy sauce, ketchup and cornstarch in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Stir continuously until the mixture has thickened.

I did everything as said in the instructions, weighed in all the ingredients correctly and the problem is with the vinegar. I don't know if I'm using the wrong vinegar or something, but as soon as I smelled the sauce when it was cooking, I thought my lungs was about to explode in my chest, I could barely taste the sauce as the vinegar felt really really strong in it.
Is it something wrong with my choice of vinegar or is the recipe faulty? I don't understand. On the bottle it says ""Food vinegar acid (9%)"".
Really need help.

Second quesadilla made on my panini press is not as crispy as the first,"I like to make quesadillas on my panini press. I typically make two for a meal.
Here is what I do:

Preheat the panini press to medium-high.
While heating, assemble the quesadillas.


I typically add cheese, shredded chicken, bacon bits, and onions. All ingredients are cold, straight out of the refrigerator. The tortilla shells themselves are the only room temperature ingredients, stored in whatever air-tight plastic bag they came in.

Once the press reports it is heated up, I cook the first quesadilla.
I remove the quesadilla when:


The cheese is visibly gooey and just starting to ooze out.
The top of the quesadilla has dark brown grill marks.

I then quickly wipe up any food particles with a dry paper towel (surface is non-stick).
Wait for the press to heat back up, give it an extra 30 seconds or so to be sure it is nice and hot.
Repeat for the second quesadilla.

What I have found is the first one I make has a nice and semi-crispy tortilla shell: it is hard and flaky, and the ends sag slightly when I pick it up in the middle.
However, the second one will have cheese oozing out and sizzling on the press, but the shell will be soft and droopy. I prefer the texture the other way.
I have tried altering the quantity of cheese, temperature, waiting longer to start cooking the second quesadilla, etc. but it does not matter. No matter what I do, the second quesadilla does not have the same exterior texture of the first one that I like.
I suspect this has something to do with either the moisture content of the tortilla shells, residual moisture on the panini press grates, or the cooking temperature. However, my experimentation has thus far not yielded any answers.
What changes do I need to make to my cooking routine so the second quesadilla comes out with a semi-crispy, hard and flaky exterior?

"What are ""fondi di carciofo"" called in English?","I would like to know what the English name is for the Italian word fondo di carciofo as I was not able to find it on the Internet. Basically, carciofo means artichoke and fondo means the bottom part (not the heart which in Italian is cuore, and not the stalk which in Italian is manico, although sometimes the stalk is included with the bottom part and sold together and such combination is very delicious indeed).
So, here is a picture of a bunch of fondi di carciofo from the Internet:

Here is the closest picture I could find on the Internet for the artichoke bottoms with stem, although the stem has been cut away from the artichoke bottoms. Too bad I could not find a picture with both in one piece as in Italy they can often be purchased in such way; next time I go to the market I will take a picture and post it.

Because of the comments that were posted below, I have included a picture of what a cuore di carciofo is in Italy (word-by-word translation: artichoke heart). Basically, it's the inner part of the artichoke with the outer leaves removed. Once cooked, unlike the outer leaves, which cannot be fully eaten as they would not be digested properly, the inner part of the artichoke can be eaten in its entirety once boiled. Here is a picture of cuori di carciofo:

On the other hand, here is the outer part of the artichoke looks like. Italian refer to this as carciofo, but often this is used as a synonym for the artichoke leaves (more commonly known as foglie di carciofo). Italians buy these in the supermarket or at the market and eat the bottom part of all of the outer leaves of the artichoke by scraping them against the bottom teeth once cooked, often dipping them in a little bit of mustard to give them some taste:

And here is a picture of what carciofini (literal translation: little artichokes) are. There are essentially the same as the cuori di carciofo (artichoke hearts), except that this version is sold in a glass jar with olive oil used to preserve them over a long period of time, and can be found in the supermarket in Italy:

That pretty much sums up the whole story about artichokes in Italy.
Anyways, back to my original question:
What's the best/proper way to translate fondi di carciofi into English?
Thanks!

Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?,"I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat.
I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a ""Hass"" avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties.
Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year.
Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo?
(I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.)
Update
By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes.

Great sauce but tiny hint of bitterness,"Made a hot sauce recently that has common ingredients found in many hot sauces. Habaneros, onions, garlic, carrots, lime juice, sugar, vinegar, tomato, salt and fruit. I used a mix of habeneros and Fresno peppers, noticed the fresno pepper had a lot of seeds. The sauce tastes great but has a very mild bitterness at the end. Is it possible that the seed ratio to sauce is giving it that mild bitterness? The balance between vinegars, lime juice and acids from the tomatoes are well balanced by the amount of sugar. Can't think of anything else, don't ever have this problem with peppers with a lower seeds ratio.

Is it possible to identify the quality of fish after cooking the fish?,"One know that a fish is fresh if the fish eye is clear and bulging and its gills is ought to be red.
However, if the fish is being cut into many slices and the fish head was being removed, it would be very hard to identify if the fish is of good quality (fresh) or poor quality (not fresh).
So, is it possible to say that when cooking a poor quality fish, the outcome is that the fish meat will be quite hard? (I mean like when one bite the cooked fish, it feel like eating a over-cook chicken breast meat.)

What could hair-like protrusions from a banana's surface be?,"I was peeling a banana, and noticed thin, hair-like protrusions coming from the stem-side top of the fruit. There were only 5 or 6, and they were sticking straight up, about an inch in height. 
At first, I thought one of my own hairs had fallen onto it, until I looked closer, and noticed there were several of them.  One, which was slightly thicker than the others, was moving back and forth within the fruit. The others appeared to be moving as well; however, this could have been due to a draft. 
Could these have been worms? Most of the objects were as thin as a spider web, except for the thicker one, which was about the width of a human hair, and were quite obvious with a quick glance.  I eat bananas often, and I have never seen the like before.

Haggis - taste difference between traditional and artificial casing,"Haggis, though considered purely Scottish could possibly have originated in the North of England.  It appears that the earliest known recipe/method is from the 15th century.  Just after a hunt, the offal was mixed with herbs, placed in the stomach lining of the (now dis-embowled) animal and cooked (a way of using parts of the animal that would otherwise have gone bad before being transported back to the manor house).  
However it is now prepared all over the world and consumed on all days of the year, not just Burns Night.  Does using an artificial casing instead of an animals stomach change the flavor in any way?  Is it necessary to obtain the stomach lining to match the taste of a traditional/authentic haggis?

The resulting bread was not too bad, but it wasn't great neither.
What is the 'proper' flour to water ratio? I've made bread with 55% water and that was OK. I know this depends on the flour, but some kind of rule of thumb must exist.

I peeled the salsify very thin, however. There were a few small spots of black peel left here and there, but since I was cooking for myself I didn't mind if it looked less than perfect. However, this might have left a bit of the sap on there and after cooking them, it has settled in my stainless steel pot on the sides, at where the water level was.

This is with regard to the Kerala beef fry or even Kerala beef curry; not the western way of cooking steak.  
The steak pieces: 1kg bought from a local beef shop where they just take a random piece of meat, chop it into little pieces of around 2 or 3 cm in size and give it to you.
What I did: Kept it in freezer for two days, took it out today and put it in water and heated the water a little. Pulled apart frozen pieces slowly in a span of an hour and allowed it to reach room temperature.
Recipe: Added spices as per this recipe and left for marination for an hour.
Pressure cooker: Put beef in cooker and heated on slow fire for 35min until there were 4 whistles/steam-let-outs that happened in a span of 2 minutes. Allowed pressure to go down and after around 20 min, opened the cooker to find the meat very rubbery. Appeared slightly cooked on the outer layer for 1 or 2 mm, but the meat inside seemed raw and when I try to tear it, it feels tough and rubbery and extends a little like when you start pulling chewing gum apart with both hands.  
Beef meat ends up like this every single time I try to cook it in a pressure cooker. I'm sure I didn't overheat it and it certainly wasn't cooked for too long. Or is it wrong to cook it in a pressure cooker and instead boil it in an open top container? I hadn't added vinegar or wine or lemon juice during marination. Could they have made a difference?  
ps: I continued heating the beef with its gravy for another 20 min on low flame, but it didn't seem to make the meat any better. So I separated the gravy and roasted it as in this recipe. The taste turned out excellent but the meat was still rubbery. So it would be much appreciated if you could help with info on ensuring that the meat is tender and well cooked when we start cooking it itself.

To my knowledge, a fruit is a sweet ""bubble"" (in that it's a membrane with a fleshy interior) of a plant's seed (they remind me of pomegranate seeds). A vegetable is part of a plant that is eaten but not part of the seed. I was under the impression that nuts were only from a specific ""branch"" of plant evolution that is predominantly trees. This information would lead me to believe it is isn't any of them. Looking into it myself, I learned the word aril, but I'm not sure if corn's kernels are like that, either.

How to bake lokum rolls well?,"These rolls are made by rolling short pastry dough thin (0.5 cm/0.2 inch), cutting it in small squares (ca. 5 cm / 2 inches) and rolling a small log of turkish delight (1x1x4 cm, 0.5x0.5x1.5 inches) in the square, resulting in a cylinder filled with turkish delight. They are baked (the turkish delight melts to a honey-like viscosity in the oven, but usually doesn't flow out), left to cool, then confectioner's sugar is sifted over them. The turkish delight filling resolidifies somewhat after cooling, but not to its completely dry state from before baking. They are not supposed to cook hard and dry and brown, they are more like Russian tea cakes in texture. 

The problem with this recipe is that more often than not, the pastry is underbaked in the middle. I think that the combination of a thick roll and getting soggy from the melted filling is responsible for the problem. However, I don't have a solution. Using less crust isn't an option - not only would the ratio of crust to filling be disturbed, but if there isn't substantial overlap in the cylinder walls, the melted lokum is likely to flow out during baking (I've had that happen). Blindbaking isn't an option - not only don't I have an idea how to hold the shape, but also the upper part of the crust will overbake during the real baking later. It is already baked at lowish temperatures, so I don't think that lowing it further will help.

Troubleshooting a soufflé that collapses during baking,"I am trying to make a cheese soufflé to surprise my girlfriend on her birthday (24 Jan). After several cooking trials, I still face a key problem: my soufflé collapsed after baking for 25-30 minutes. 
What did I do wrong? Here are the steps to the recipe;

boil equipment
grease butter to the renakin, place into the freezer
separate egg whites (no yolk mixed)
add a little salt to egg whites
add a little sugar to egg whites 
using a hand mixer, whip the egg whites adding more sugar during whip
melt 40g butter (100C)
Whisk 40g all purpose flour into melted butter
pour 250g milk slowly and whisk util it mixed
wait until it cools down
re-grease butter to the renakin, place into the freezer
beat the egg yolks to a creamy consistency, then pour into the milk mixture
add 1/3 of the mixture to the base, continue to add the whites folding very gently.
Preheat oven to 200C (5-10 minutes)
pour the mixture into the renakin
add the cheese on the top
bake at 170'C (with heat select=""lower"")

After about 25-30 minutes and a 2cm rise, the soufflé collapses prior to removing from oven.

updated 19 Jan Evening :
I do

buy better hand mixer
use more flour (50g)
move egg whites whipping process to last steps
reduce whipping time to 5 minutes
bake with heat select=""lower"" about 15min after that change to ""upper and lower""
sit in front of oven and see the soufflé every moment.

result:

at 20mins: the soufflé raise about 3.5 to 4cm (from 5cm height renakin)
around 25mins: it collapse about 0.5cm, so I immediately remove it from oven (T-T)
after than it collapse very fast. (I guess it is common)

Sprinkle a little salt in the skillet before frying fish to prevent the fish from sticking. Sprinkle salt on washed skillets, waffle iron plates or griddles, heat in a warm oven, dust off salt; when they are next used, foods will not stick.

I've heard this more than once but never tried this, because I simply can't imagine why or how this works, and mostly the descriptions are a bit vague (for example, what temperature should a ""warm oven"" be?).
If it does work, how long does the effect last, just the next time it's used? And would there be remains of salt left in the pan when it's used next, so that one should use salt with caution after applying this procedure?

Smoking Boston Butt and Smoker Went out - Food Safety,"I borrowed a buddies pellet smoker to test it out. I got it going bright this morning. Got it up to about 225 and loaded it up a 6.5 pound Boston Butt. It never really stayed at 225, but hovered between 200 and 225 for the first 3-4 hours of cooking.
Then the fire went out, it started to drop. The meat was around 130. I wrapped it in tin foil and set it on my outdoor table while I looked at the smoker. After an hour of not getting it going again, I put it in the oven @ 225. After another hour I got the smoker working. Turns out the fan got jammed up and I had to get it moving.
So the question is, is my food still safe? A summary of the facts:

6.5 Boston Butt smoked for about 3-4 hours @ 200-225, temp got to
around 130.
Fire went out, It spent one hour in foli and an other
hour in the oven @ 225.
Temp when going back onto the smoker was
about 125.
Now everything is working, it is running @ 250 and the
meat is 163.
I plan on cooking it to 195 or 203 (if time permits).

Is there any point in considering sous vide for unskilled newbie cook?,"I was considering sous vide as a present for someone, but - being wholly unfamiliar with that cooking method myself except it being trendy - don't know how use(ful|less) of a present that is for them.
Is there any point in considering sous vide for unskilled newbie cook who doesn't have too much time to devote to cooking?
Specifically, by that I mean someone who doesn't have the time, drive, or natural inclination to be a more expert cook. They don't even use thermometers. They don't cook fancy (or even simply complicated) dishes and most of the time cook same simple staples (steak, stew, soup, simple pasta, roast fish, stir fry, etc...). As far as I'm aware they never cooked a sauce, or anything requiring two stages of cooking. They don't usually have the time to cook anything that requires constant supervision for more than an hour; they are at home for 2-3 hours after work 6 days a week; during which time they are busy.

However, in the video on this Kickstarter page (at around 1.00), she simply puts the steak in a sealed Ziploc bag and then into the water bath, without evacuating the bag. So, are my concerns unfounded?

Cooking pizza in tiny gas oven with pizza stone,"I currently have a tiny gas oven to cook with this summer and I like to cook a lot of pizzas, but I have always cooked them in standard electric home ovens.
I have been doing some reading here and here, but I don't think I have enough information yet.
Typically, I cook the pizzas on a 15"" stone with store bought fresh dough and follow these steps:

Preheat oven with stone for at least 30 min at 425 F
Put dough in for about 2 min by itself
Layer on toppings
Push back into oven for 10-15 minutes (depends on the oven)

My current oven will fit my 13"" pizza stone, has a single flame rod (whatever that's called) on the bottom that starts in the back and extends towards the front. I cannot see into the oven as I normally would to watch the browning of the crust.
So a couple questions:

How long will the pizza take to cook at some temperature? (<= 500 F)
Do I need to let the dough sit by itself in the oven?

Concerns:

Opening the door too much to check the pizza (I know gas fluctuates more)
Burning (one the SO references said 90 seconds to cook)

What is the best way to reheat a sub-style sandwich?,"So you go to a deli, pizza place, or any number of places that will sell you a 12""+ hot sandwich (e.g. a philly cheeseteak).  You eat half and save the other half for another day.  When that other day comes, what's the best way to reheat it?
For many other foods, the most common ways are microwave, toaster oven, regular oven and skillet.  Unconventional ways I can think of would be steaming and sous vide (though the latter seems excessive for a sandwich).

We know that you can cook longer than planned without any problems with Sous Vide, but an extra 48 hours seems like we might be tempting fate.
Are we better off

letting the ribs cook for another 48 hours, or
pulling the ribs out on time and refrigerating/freezing them for the 2 days, and then finishing them in the oven right before we serve them, or
pull the ribs out tonight, finish them in the oven, then refrigerate them for 2 days, and reheat them?

Edit & Follow-up:
Most. Tender. Ribs. EVER!
As suggested, took the ribs out on time, chilled, and then tonight they were warmed in the sous vide cooker for about 30 minutes then finished in the oven. The meat was sliding off the bones, fork tender (for those who didn't use their fingers) and the whole family was raving about how awesome they were.  This method is a keeper for sure!

Is there any substitute for saltpeter / sodium nitrate in corned beef brine?,"I realize there is another question about corned beef from scratch, but the answers don't really cover my question. Many recipes for making your own corned beef still refer to the use of saltpeter (potassium nitrate) or sodium nitrate.  From what I've been able to find out saltpeter is never used anymore nor available to the home cook, and sodium nitrate is  not commonly available.
Sodium nitrate in the brine gives cooked corned beef its classic reddish color (without it corned beef comes out gray), and it kills botulism spores. I like my corned beef pink (the gray color is somewhat unappetizing), but more than that I'm concerned about the flavor of the corned beef. The last time I made corned beef I tried to use Morton Tender Quick. The cooked brisket turned out beautifully pink and almost inedible. It was terribly salty and actually made my tongue numb.
So, is there anything that can be used in place of the sodium nitrate, if used in the proper quantities does its absence or presence have any effect on the flavor of the corned beef, and is there any good place to get it?

"Pressure Cooker ""Safety Fuse Plate"" Bubbles During Use","I recently bought a 9.5 Quart Tramontina Pressure Cooker for the purpose of cooking dried beans and legumes since I've moved to an altitude that makes simple stove top cooking impractical. 
I've only used the cooker twice, and each time, it pressure locks but steam/bubbles continue to come out of the handle (on and off), the manual pressure release valve (frequently) and something called the ""safety fuse plate"" (almost continuously). Very little steam comes out of the pressure limiting valve from what I can tell.
I am not familiar with pressure cooking, but have done quite a bit of reading and cannot figure out if this is normal or unsafe or really anything. I know I'm not overfilling it and I doubt the pressure is too high. The food does not come out cooked/finished, although that could be due to incorrectly adjusting the times for the altitude.
So my questions are:
1) Is this normal?
2) Does this sound unsafe?
Happy to provide any more information as requested.

I think I have identified two probable reasons:
1)  I skipped the egg was at the end.  So the top layer was just really dry.
2)  I probably overworked the dough.  I used the pizza dough setting on my breadmaker which takes 90 minutes.
I used butter that was almost frozen.  And I chilled my water in the freezer for 10 minutes before mixing.  I think I did those parts right.
Next time I will try just working the dough by hand and handling it as little as possible.  And I definitely won't skip the egg wash.

Could oxidation of oil in frozen fish be causing smell which I am mistakening for overcooking?,"I posted some questions about overcooking whitebait and am wondering if the cause of this smell, since it appears so quickly is overcooking or fish oil oxidation.  I found the following which makes me think it could be due to oil oxidation when freezing and hence not due to any overcooking:
""In frozen fish, bacterial action is reduced to negligible levels but oxidation of the oil, especially in oily fish, will continue during storage and will lead to a loss of eating quality. Some of the proteins in fish undergo changes, not fully understood, during long periods of frozen storage which lead to undesirable toughening of the flesh."" 
It's extremely difficult to get fresh whitebait so I have nothing to compare it against or verify that this is a frozen fish oxidation issue.  I am also sensitive to chemicals\smells so it could be that I can sense the oxidised oil wherease most people can't.

Am I overcooking whitebait in water by using scum as a measure for doneness?,"I understand that small fish like whitebait should be cooked in two minutes and anything above is probably overcooking. Of course a better guide is to go by temperature and the fish being opaque.
Well I understand that once the fish is at 145f/63c it is done however this is also the temperature at which those white bubbles(scum?) come out of the fish?
Therefore I went with the ide that once the scum starts rising to the top the water the fish is cooked.
To be safe I allowed the scum to rise to the top(which started after 5 minutes of simmering) then switched the heat off and removed the scum.  I noticed the water still tastes unusual i.e. perhaps I had overcooked it.

I mixed it last night per a recipe that called for: 300 g. starter, 570-600g cold water, mixed into starter, then, 1 kilogram bread flour and 18g. salt., and I converted all measurements, if I did it correctly, to: -1c. starter, 2 1/3 c. ice water, 4 1/4 c. bread flour, and I used less salt, because we do not like salt much. there were explicit directions, plus pictures, at Fig Jam and Lime Cordial...(if I'm allowed to let you see the recipe I used), but mine appeared wrong from the start. 
Questions are: 1.  Did I convert the recipe correctly? 2. Was recipe too 'weak' to begin with? 3. Could I have over-proofed it, to where there was no structure left?

I baked cupcakes with it and the entire batch of cupcakes fell (there was a crater-like indention in every cupcake).  All of my cane sugar cupcakes rose nicely.  In the cupcakes, I didn't notice much of a different flavor (they still tasted really good despite sinking in the middle).  But when I made fresh lemonade with the coconut sugar, all I could taste was burnt sugar.  Does coconut sugar normally taste burned or could it have just been the brand I bought?  I can't believe coconut sugar is so popular if it all tastes burned.

Why add Wheat Germ to Bread?,"A blogger I generally trust recently posted a recipe for a simple, brown soda bread.

What gives Vietnamese Chicken the red tint?,"A local oriental restaurant used to sell ""Vietnamese Chicken"", a hot plate dish of big chunks of chicken breast with onion and spices.

At one point they must have changed their recipe and the chicken is no longer red, just common yellowish typical to any fried chicken:

I can't really notice a difference in taste (maybe because it was a couple months since I had ""red"" until I bought ""Vietnamese Chicken"" and it was now yellow) - still, I'm curious what spice (or whatever other means) can give chicken meat this red coloration, and try making this dish myself.

What are the natural and artificial sugars?,"I try to be careful to avoid hydrogenation and artificial sugars when I buy food products.  Hydrogenation seems easy - if it mentions hydrogenation in the ingredients list, I avoid it.  I feel more confused by sugars.
So, for example, sugar and honey I feel comfortable with.  Corn syrup I feel comfortable with.  High fructose corn syrup and aspartame I avoid.
The problem is that there are so many sugars that I have trouble keeping them straight.  Sucrose, glucose, maltodextrine - those are chemical names, to be sure, but to my knowledge they are ""natural"" in the sense that they are naturally derived.  I think.
Can someone post a list of the various sugars that we see in ingredient lists - or that we have the option to use as ingredients in the foods we make - with an explanation of whether they are natural or not?  Or to what degree they are not natural?
Now, I understand that ""natural"" means different things to different people, so I expect some qualification will be needed for at least some ingredients.  Also, to narrow the focus of the question and the resulting answers, let's keep this focused on the list and short description of the various sugars as opposed to the broader discussion concerning whether artificial sweeteners are bad for you or not.

Update
I guess this isn't a very popular question.  Perhaps people who care about this as I do generally understand the ingredient lists better?
So today I ran into an example of what I'm describing above. I noticed polydextrose in an ingredient list.  What I would have liked to do is come back to this question and look at an answer to this post that has that ingredient as artificial or natural with a brief description of it.  However, this isn't in the incomplete list of artificial sweeteners posted in the answer by TFD (I don't mean for this to be offensive - at least you answered with something, which I appreciate).  Not being a dietician, I looked it up and it looks pretty artificial to me.

How to cook fallow deer ribs?,"Yesterday I tried to make fallow deer ribs in a slow cooker. With beef ribs, I cooked them in a temperature-controlled slow-cooker for about 12 hours at 75 °C = 167 °F and they where amazing!
Done the same with fallow deer ribs, and they came out so dry that I had to cut the meat off the bones and blend it with hot water into a creamy soup to be able to eat it somehow.
I happen to have a moisture analyzer, and the meat after being slow cooked had only 55% moisture, while raw had 75%, so it lost 60% of its water during cooking.
Fallow deer is more tender then the common red deer, and also less fatty then beef I think (at least this piece). I even wrapped the whole thing in large cabbage leaves to prevent moisture loss, but it didn't help.
This is the piece before cooking: 

I find it difficult to find a good way to prepare something which is on the bone, but so lean and tender. I find it easier to do with tough and fatty meat. Despite the meat attached to the bone being very tender, the bones are holding tightly, so I can't cut this into rib chops - I don't think I have a tool which can manage to cut this.
Boneless pieces of fallow dear I just sear for a few minutes on a pan and they are tender and great. But here I wanted to do something so the meat falls off the bone nicely, so I slow-cooked it, which ruined it.
I have another fallow-deer rib rack like that, how not to ruin it this time?

Are all emulsifying agents created equal,"My question relates to the 5 of 6 emulsifying agents I am aware of for stabilizing emulsification. 
namely; egg yolk, garlic, mustard, tomato paste, honey, and cream. 
I haven't personally used each of these as as emulsifying agents but that's the extent of my list. Anyways. So my question is, for any given particular emulsion does there exist a most useful emulsifying agent to Stabilize that particular emulsion? For instance, if I am making an oil in water emulsion, like a hollandaise sauce where the emulsifying agent is the egg yolk or whatever, would egg yolks yield an equally stabilized emulsion if used in an water in oil emulsion like a vinaigrette? Or would an alternative absent be more appropriate for that type of emulsion?
Again, not interested in any specific case, more of the general answer. I imagine the emulsifying agent is useful because it has both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic side, kind of like dish soap, which lends it to uniting oils and waters so well... I don't know though if there are particular characteristics about specific emulsions that would make mustard more appropriate in one case but not as desirable in another.
Obviously this is assuming all other variables being equal, and with out consideration necessarily of taste... I mean this is cooking so everything has to do with taste but you know what I mean

Honestly, i'm really not mad. I've been tested.
For the savoury dessert, i plan to make that celebrated stodgy English treat, jam roly-poly. To make it savoury, i will use something like red pesto instead of jam. Or it might be a savoury version of some other suet pudding - spotted dick or figgie hobbin with olives instead of currants, perhaps.

Why does oil transfer heat to food more gradually than water?,"While working on the homework for week 2 of Harvardx's Edx course, SPU27x Science & Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science, I came across this question:

The difference in the specific heats for water and oil is important
  for cooking. For example, oil heats faster and you are less likely to
  overcook food if you cook it in oil than water. Briefly explain these
  observations, using the scientific ideas from this week.

We are asked to write a short response to it, and after submitting it, we are given a grading rubric and asked to do a self assessment. Here is my response:

While it is true that oil heats faster than water due to its lower
  specific heat capacity, it is not true that food is less likely to be
  overcooked than water. The boiling point of oil is generally much
  higher than that of water (about 250-350 degrees Celsius compared to
  100 degrees Celsius). This means that when cooking food in oil, it is
  very likely that your food will reach temperatures much higher than if
  they were cooked in water. Knowing that a liquid's temperature stays
  constant at the boiling point, food cooked in water will never go
  beyond 100 degrees Celsius, so you are less likely to burn food in
  water than if you were to cook in oil, as the reactions that result in
  burns do not occur at that temperature, but do occur in the boiling
  point of oils.

and the rubric we are given states:

A full answer contains at least two of the following ideas :

Oil has a lower specific heat than water.
Oil can be heated to high temperatures with relatively smaller input of energy than water.
At a fixed temperature, oil transfers heat more gradually to food than water at the same temperature.
In liquid form, oil can be heated to a higher temperature than water. 

You may use different words to express these concepts, so judge
  your response based on the meaning of your answer, rather than
  expecting your wording to match this exactly.

So it looks like my response is quite different from the suggested answer. In particular, I am confused that the provided answer does not explicitly address whether it is true that food is less likely to overcook in oil. I am also unsure why oil transfers heat more gradually to food than does water.
I would really appreciate it if anyone could clarify my questions, and also give me some feedback on my response.

How to modify a bread recipe to accomodate longer proofing times?,"I used to bake a lot but since I've switch jobs, I do not have enough time in the evening anymore. But I work really close from home so I can go home for lunch if needed.
My idea is to start the bread in the morning before work, then return for the second kneading during lunch, then I can bake it at night. I know that I need to lower the temperature during the proofing, so I though of putting the dough in the refrigerator.
Will this work? Is there other ways to achieve what I'd like?

What can I change about this bread recipe to lower its glycemic index?,"I'm starting with a recipe from Peter Reinhart's Whole Grain Breads that uses an overnight autolyse of a soaker (whole wheat flour, your choice of other grains, salt, and water) and a refrigerated  biga (whole wheat flour, a small bit of commercial yeast, and water). The recipe is for a hearth bread. I grind my own hard white wheat on the finest grind my KitchenAid mixer attachment can manage.
I'm looking to increase the fiber and protein content. The options I'm looking at in the ""other grain"" category include 

psyllium husk: I am having a great deal of difficulty finding any instructions on baking with psyllium husk outside of gluten free baking, which I am obviously not doing. I am most concerned with how the psyllium might impact the water content of the recipe and how much is too much, given how small a standard serving is. I don't even know if using psyllium husk is a good idea given that no one seems to have tried it before.
chia seeds: like psyllium, there aren't a lot of resources on using chia in wheat breads. I found one website that said it worked in commercial applications as up to 5% of the bread without changing much. In my recipe that works out to about 1 oz. Does that make sense?
wheat bran: I have so far found one recipe that used a cup of wheat bran to 2 cups of white flour and 1/2 cup of whole grain mix. It seems like I can safely use a good portion of wheat bran, but I'm unsure of exactly how much
vital wheat gluten: I have always seen a suggestion to use about 1 1/2 tsp. of wheat gluten per 1 c. of wheat flour for increased wheat dough elasticity. How high can I push the wheat content before it gets to be too much? My recipe allows for the ""other grains"" to be up to 33% of the baker's percentage. Could I use the whole thing on bran or would that taste like sandpaper?
flax seed meal: I've seen people online adding 1/4 to 1/3 c. of flax to bread recipes. Does that sound about right?

Am I missing any high fiber or high protein seeds or grains that I should consider (like a bean, perhaps?).

How do I fix the issue with white film on utensils in dishwashers? Is it okay to use dishwashers if water hardness is 900 ppm?,"I've purchased a Dishwasher from Bosch (SMS60L18IN). We were very satisfied with it's first wash when it gave us clean utensils without any problems. We put a 3 in 1 tablet then. Now, I use a special salt, detergent and Rinse aid... all from Finish.
From the 2nd wash onwards, it started giving white film on almost all utensils and food residues are not cleaned on some.
I tried all workarounds that I found online like changing detergent amounts and using the venegar trick.
The issue I was thinking and the company engineers suspecting is the water hardness which is around 900 (or 920) ppm. They changed the hardness level in the machine of to H7 (this is the max one for 8.9mmol/L hardness that the company specified) suggested me to run the machine for a few cycles to get rid of water residue from previous cycles.
I've already ran four cycles and the issue still persists. Is the water hardness the cause alone? Would be there other issues like the detergent or salt?
Following are the things that I observed:

The first wash was perfect. We haven't used sale here. Second and
third washes are a bit okay. 
In the second wash. We put a 1.5 kg of specially recommended salt (it's brand is Finish) 
Issue worsened from the fourth wash. 
I realized that I haven't filled the salt resorvoir with water (the company recommends to fill it with water when you use the machine for the first time) and then filled it with a glass of water.
The company technicians said that is not a big issue as the machine will itself dilute the salt with water after 2 or 3 washes. 
I ran the machine by pouring a cup of vinegar as suggested in some articles and I found that the white layer on the machines door was gone and utensils in the next wash are somewhat clean. Also, I tried changing detergent amounts, rinse raid quantity settings and switching hardness levels with each wash.
Tried changing the size of the load with each wash
Even if we purchase a budget softener like this, it may have low output rates and that gives new problems.
And an important thing is that we believe it's too noisy (it gives knocking sounds while rinsing) like a cloth washing machine. The company staff said it is normal or I guess it is not that loud when they are around:)

More details

Name of the detergent, salt and rinse-aid's brand is Finish 
Am I still using all-in-one tables? No

The company staff recommended water softeners (of a different brand as they don't sell softeners). But I fear if it brings new issues like the change in flow rate (individual tap softeners have low flow rate, i.e., 2 litres per minute where as the dishwasher requires 6 litres per minutre). Ours is a rented house so I can't install a permanent or full house water softener.
Could anybody tell me if you find any other issues here other than the water hardness? Any suggestions or solutions are welcome.

Is Dextrose the same as Atomized Glucose Powder?,"I have been making some yummy sorbets and ice creams. 
Many recipes call for atomized glucose powder. However, 'atomized glucose powder' is not that readily available. 'Dextrose', however, is commonly available at local heath food stores here in Southern California. 
There is some debate if dextrose is the same as atomized glucose. Specifically, look at this thread on eGullet where it is stated:

Dextrose is a type of glucose but is sweeter. Atomized glucose has
  what is called a sweetness coefficent of 50 while dextrose has one of
  75.

Here are some other data points:
1. Wikipedia states:  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose)


Glucose (also known as D-glucose, dextrose, or grape sugar) is a
  simple monosaccharide found in plants.

2. Harold McGee in 'On Food and Cooking' states (p. 653 in the most recent edition):


Glucose, also called dextrose, is a simple sugar, and the most common sugar from which living cells directly extract chemical energy.

3. The Culinary Institute of America's 'Mastering the Art of Craft of Baking and Pastry', 
   2nd edition states in the glossary (p. 914)


Glucose: A monosaccaride that occurs naturally in fruits, some vegetables, and honey. Also known as dextrose.

4. Heston Blumenthal's 'The Fat Duck Cookbook' in the Science section (p. 456):


Glucose: Arguably, glucose is the most important and widespread sugar molecule in biology.
All glucose molecules come in two versions, a left-handed version called L-glucose and a right handed version called D-glucose. D-glucose is the only type produced by nature and the only type used in food. 

I am persnickety about using just the right ingredient. Is dextrose powder that you find at the health food store exactly the same as the expensive imported atomized glucose powders that need to be ordered from a specialty pastry supplier? Or is ordering fancy French atomized glucose powder a pain when you can just buy 'dextrose' and substitute 1:1.  
Most atomized glucose powder comes from Europe and dextrose is from American sources. Is this just a different term for the same thing?

Should I refrigerate homemade yogurt before making Greek yogurt?,"I have a yogurt maker and a so-called Greek yogurt maker; the latter is basically a fancy strainer. Both gadgets are from Euro Cuisine. My process for making yogurt is as follows:

Scald milk at about 180º F for about 20 minutes
Let milk cool to between 100 and 110º F
Add starter culture
Incubate in yogurt maker for 8 hours
Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.

The yogurt seems pretty thick to me when I take it out of the machine after the incubation, but the instructions that came with the yogurt maker say that the last step, refrigerating, is needed for the yogurt to set properly. 
The instructions that came with the Greek yogurt maker say:

Put yogurt into strainer
Leave in refrigerator for at least 4 hours, longer for greater thickness.

My question is: if I make a batch of regular yogurt intending to convert it to Greek yogurt, do I need to follow the last step of refrigerating the yogurt for 4 hours before putting it in the strainer to make Greek yogurt? Or can I just put the yogurt into the strainer as soon as the 8 hour incubation period is done?

You can move the content of your yogurt made in the YM100 into GY50 after yogurt is ready, without putting the yogurt in the refrigerator for 4 hours.

Coating the vegetables with flour after browning and cooking the flour before adding the browned meat and liquids.
For certain braises, Escoffier recommends mixing in roux before adding the liquids.

Is there a low tyramine substitute for tamari?,"Help replacing miso and tamari for health reasons

I am a non-junk-food-vegan for health reasons.  Technically I'm ""whole foods plant based"" (WFPB).  It basically means I stay away from animal products and processed foods (like oils and sugars).  When our family made this change, some of us experienced remission of serious conditions  (like: hypothyroidism, anemia, angina with cardiovascular disease, and one is just beginning to fight diabetes and obesity with the lifestyle. So far so good.--You go Sis!)  
But one health problem I had remained: headaches.  Then I discovered I had a sensitivity to tyramine.  Poof!  Headaches and brain fog gone!    But, avoiding tyramine has pushed me to avoid nuts, seeds and anything aged.  Aged ingredients, like many cheeses, vinegar, tofu, dried fruit, are very high tyramine.

I've been able to substitute for some high tyramine items:
• allspice for nutmeg
• lemon juice for vinegar (ok in small amounts)
• butternut squash for sweet potatoes
• very fresh bananas for fully ripe bananas
• blended cannellini beans for tofu (in sauces)

I have considered substituting Redmond's Real Sea Salt and liquid smoke for tamari.  
Is there another (non-nut-based) seasoning that would help?

NOTA BENE: I know I haven't said what I am using the tamari for. I'm just looking for some ideas to keep on hand.  Tamari and miso would usually be added to bean soups, mushroom gravies, dry-sautéed onions, hummus, or even a savory oatmeal with spinach. (Scrumptious--who knew!)

Combining whetstones from different manufacturers,"I recently received two whetstones for my birthday, this chroma and this naniwa. The chroma stone feels very ""hard"" and heavy, while the naniwa stone is considerably ""softer"" and lighter. I am a beginner in sharpening knives, so I started practising on very old knives. The results are acceptable, but not too good. It feels like the naniwa stone (both sides) doesn't add to the sharpness anymore. Also sharpening on the chroma is much louder and feels more productive than on the naniwa, even when I change from 800 on the chroma to 1000 on the naniwa. 

Is it possible that those two stones are not compatible somehow, because they are of a different sort (the chroma feels ""hard"" while the naniwa feels ""soft"")?

I put the chicken breasts (boneless with skin on and wing attached from a local farm) into a preheated 375 degree oven.  After 45 minutes I checked them and they looked done but the juices we're still a bit cloudy, but not any pink.  I decided to be on the safe side and put them in for another 15 minutes. 
Afterwards when I checked them again and then cut them into pieces I used the same utensils I'd used to check them the first time.
What are the chances of someone getting sick from this? I'm assuming very low, but she has a 1 year old that ate a couple bites of it as well.  I'm usually very careful around chicken but I wasn't thinking.

What makes meat overly juicey?,"Yesterday I cooked a steak and today I cooked another (from the same cute). Today it turned out much better and on reflection it was because it was LESS juicy.

"Sous Vide at 165F - Air formed in the bag, is this natural? Bad?","I am cooking a pork butt roast sous vide. I am following this recipe. 
https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-bbq-pork-shoulder
My bag had no or very little air in it after sealing and when the cooking started. Since cooking for a few hours the meat has shrunk considerably in size within the bag. But the bag also has new air in it. Enough to make it float. 
I am worried I could have bad bacteria and make my guests sick. 
Here is more of my thoughts:
1) According to some articles I have read this could simply be vapor. At 165F the meat is hot enough to release some water to vapor. 
2) Maybe while coming to temperature some bacteria did grow, but at 165F, that bacteria is now dead. Even though the air remains, the meat is safe to eat. The dead bacteria and/or their waste are not harmful. 
3) I grew a bunch of bacteria and this is not safe to eat.

What is in a Jamaican Chocolate Cheesecake?,"I'm interested in making a variation of this baked Jamaican Chocolate Cheesecake from the Cheesecake Shop. The description from the website is not terribly useful in identifying what the possible ingredients are:

A smooth, baked chocolate cheesecake crowned with mouthwatering
  chocolate shavings, and lightly dusted with icing sugar.

I've searched the internet fruitlessly for a ""Jamaican Chocolate Cheesecake"" recipe. There are a few other Jamaican Cheesecake recipes but they mostly seem to involve ingredients that are Jamaican (e.g. ""Jamaican mangos"") so I'm under the impression that the chocolate is Jamaican and it isn't a style of cheesecake. (Is ""Jamaican chocolate"" a thing? I couldn't find that either...)
The closest I can find is recipes for ""Jamaican Hot Chocolate"" and ""Jamaican Chocolate Tea"" which involve some cinnamon and maybe nutmeg and other flavours.
Short of getting the people at the shop to give me the ingredients, which I doubt they would do, I'm at a loss as to what goes in this cake. This website has a non-promo photo of the cake, including the inside after it is cut: http://blog.stillaslife.com/food/jamaican-chocolate-cheesecake-from-the-cheesecake-shop/ 
Has anyone heard of this type of cake before and know what goes in it?

Unfortunately I haven't tasted the cheesecake. A choc-orange variety was requested so I'm just left guessing what else could be in it. I was mostly hoping it was a more common recipe than it is...

I ended up contacting them and it is just a normal chocolate cheesecake with a chocolate biscuit base. I inquired if it had rum or cinnamon or anything and they said no they just add cocoa to the normal vanilla cheesecake mix.
I'm going to award the answer to LoganGoesPlaces for the useful info and because their idea is very creative and sounds tasty.

It could be that I'm overcooking as Ive noticed the same smell when cooking other fish however i am cooking within a few minutes and like I say the smell appears as the fish heats so perhaps is not from overcooking.

What ended up happening was the ice melted and the whole bag got soaked so now they are all wet and a little mushy? Is there a way to salvage them? I plan on just baking them but idk if they are okay to eat anymore. Or is it okay if they are wet? After reading how to actually store asparagus, I probably know now I don't need to thaw them.

Can I use parboiled basmati rice just like ordinary non-converted basmati?,"tl;dr Do the cooking time, behavior, taste, and texture of parboiled rice differ significantly enough from non-converted rice such that a simple substitution will yield undesirable results? 
I accidentally purchased a large bag of parboiled basmati rice. I make a variety of dishes with basmati rice, but I've never tried any of them with the parboiled version. Can I just use the parboiled rice in place of the non-parboiled? Or do I need to make various adjustments to cooking times, steps in a recipe, methods, etc? And will the results (taste, texture) be different from non-parboiled even with said adjustments?
For example, here is my basic basmati rice recipe, which I make in a pressure cooker. Will this recipe work with parboiled?

Rinse 1 cup rice until it runs clear
Let drain ~15 minutes in colander
Heat 1 tbsp oil or ghee in pressure cooker
When hot, sauté the rice for a minute or so
Add 1.5 cups of water or vegetable stock
Close pressure cooker lid and wait for full (high) pressure
Manually pressure cook for four minutes.
Let pressure come down naturally
Fluff and serve.

Also, the directions on the bag say to soak the parboiled rice for an hour before cooking. I don't typically have the time for this: the whole point of rice is that it's easy and quick to make. But plenty of recipes using basmati, including ones for just plain basmati by itself (i.e., white rice with no added meats or veggies, as in the preparation above), ask for the rice to be soaked, and I never do; I just wash it and let it drain for about 15 minutes. Is soaking de rigeur for parboiled?
Finally,  I'm worried that cooking times for more elaborate dishes will be thrown off by the parboiled rice, resulting in unevenly-cooked mixtures of rice, veggies, spices, and (on the rare occasions I cook it) meat; and that the resulting dish will be significantly altered in taste and texture as a result of using the parboiled rice instead of white. 
Are these concerns valid?

Corn structure. Does it feel mealy, or smooth to the tooth?

General use. I assume it can be used as white rice, so I am not asking you to list how to use it. But are there uses for which it can't be used? Risoto is probably a no-brain example, are there other dishes where the use of black rice will be so bad as to cause the dish to fail?
Taste. Is there something very specific about its taste, or is it within the usual variety to be expected from rice?
Misc. If there is something important I forgot to include, feel free to include it in your answer.

Why is there a 2 step heating process for making custard for ice cream,"I make ice cream frequently, with pretty good results, and I follow the same basic process for making the custard. This is the method I've seen repeated in many different recipes which involves:

Heating the milk and cream, plus about 2/3 of the sugar in a pan until it starts to steam (about 130F) and the sugar is dissolved
Whipping the remaining sugar with the egg yolks until pale yellow
Gradually adding some of the hot milk/cream mixture to the yolks
Adding the yolks and cream back into the pan with the rest of the cream
Gently heating the mix until it forms a custard (I usually heat until 155F or so using a thermometer)
Remove from heat, add flavors, then chill the mix

Now this works for me and is very reliable, but as I was making a batch of mint base last night I couldn't help but think why step 1, and therefore 3 and 4 is necessary. 
Why pre-heat the milk, cream and sugar, then heat again after the yolks are added?  I know that you add a bit of hot cream to the yolks so that they don't get shocked, that's not my question. Why not whip the yolks and some of the sugar, then put them into cold milk and cream and heat the whole mix?

"Roasting smaller, thinly skinned peppers - removing peel","I roast red bell peppers all the time. I use a number of methods, but most typically I slice them in half longitudinally, roast at 450F cut side down on a foil lined sheet tray treated with non-stick spray until they are thoroughly blackened and blistered. Straight out of the oven I put them in a sealed Tupperware type container (to steam) until they are cool enough to handle, then the blackened skins come right off. Easy, and I love the results.
I'd love to do the same kind of thing with smaller, sometimes hotter peppers (jalapeno, serrano, poblano and even habanero), but my attempts have always failed. The outermost skin doesn't blister away from the ""meat"" of the pepper the way it does for bell peppers, and by the time the skins are blackened, the meat of the pepper is mush.
The biggest problem seems to be that the bell pepper has a thick, meaty, juicy (ready to generate steam) wall, while the other peppers do not. I can get that roasted caramelization effect easily with any pepper, but I'd like to eliminate most of the peel while maintaing some of the structure of the pepper. Does anyone know of a way to pull this off? (so to speak)

Is copper cookware really better than stainless steel?,"This is somewhat related to the question about copper vs. cast iron, but this is about copper vs. pure stainless steel.
I had an old stainless steel stockpot that warped (it was very, very cheap stainless steel, paper thin) and have to replace it ASAP.  I have a family member with a few connections that gets a deep discount on one of the more expensive brands.  I asked her to look into getting me a copper stockpot (lined with stainless steel, of course, so the reactivity problem more or less goes away), and got this response as an explanation to why it is apparently unavailable here:

[...] there is apparently no advantage cooking-wise to using copper, and people just buy it for the look.
[...] None of our big accounts, including [XYZ] etc even had any interest in stocking it, which is why we never brought it in.

Note that these stores do carry the same brand of stainless steel products, just not copper.
Now, I am taking this with a grain pile of salt because (a) this family member never cooks and (b) the advice came from a marketing manager who obviously wants to push the products that are available locally.  Nevertheless, I think it's worth asking people with knowledge/experience:
Is there actual evidence confirming any of the advantages of copper cookware (durability, conductivity, heat spread, etc.)?  Has it actually been proven anywhere that copper is (or is not) superior to stainless steel?
Or are articles like these just parroting a bunch of myths?
I'm looking for strong evidence here, so please answer only if you are prepared to back it up.
Clarification (with apologies to Ward): I am looking for evidence of the practical benefits.  It's obviously indisputable and easy to look up the fact that copper is a better conductor than steel, and lighter; the question is, does this matter with respect to responsiveness, hot spots, and so on?

Breadcrumbs or flour when greasing and dusting a cake form?,"I unthinkingly followed a recipe for a type of chocolate cake where it said to dust the cake form with breadcrumbs after greasing. Unsurprisingly the toasted breadcrumbs were clearly visible on the outside of the cake after baking.

This wasn't a big deal and the crumbs were easy enough to brush off anyway, but it got me thinking: when is it better to dust with breadcrumbs and when is it better to use flour?
For my chocolate cake, if I'd stopped to think, I would have used a flour/cocoa mixture. If I were making a delicate sponge most likely I would go for flour there too.
What about breadcrumbs though? Perhaps the batter is less likely to stick to the form if dusted with breadcrumbs? Or would you use breadcrumbs to add a little crunch to the cake's outer surfaces (can't say I noticed any crunch myself).

"Exactly how much is ""one glass"", in Russian recipes?","In many many Russian recipes, measurements call for one glass or this one glass of that.
One glass in Russia, appears to be a similar concept to what one cup is in United States.
But here lies a problem, I will run down the list:

USSR mass-produced a certain type of faceted glass that pretty much everyone had in Russia.  The facets on the glass ended before reaching the top of the glass, thus marking a natural edge.

Pouring water into glass up to that edge == 200 milliliters
Pouring water till the top of the glass = 250 milliliters


It is NEVER specified if you are to fill up till the edge or to the top. 
Now Russia produces all kinds of ""glasses"".  Looking around Russian native sites, I see that one glass can be anywhere from 180g, 200g, 250g.  Also, measuring water, sugar, and flour by volume this way, will produce different weight.

Using maida + bread flour to create AP flour substitute,"This is a follow-up to my earlier question about using bread flour instead of all-purpose flour in a banana bread recipe. The consensus was that using bread flour would yield a denser, chewier loaf, which could be undesirable (or perhaps desirable, depending on the eaters' preferences). 
Among the flours I have at hand is maida. As explained here and here, maida is a soft flour with around 7.5% gluten, similar to what is sold as cake flour in the US. My understanding from the Cooking for Engineers article linked from the latter question is that using such a low-gluten flour for this recipe would not be good:

Cake flour is produced from soft wheat and is low in gluten content (8-10%). This flour is used for making delicate cakes. Baked goods made with cake flour has a tendency to crumble because of the low gluten content. 

This is the opposite danger to the one of using bread flour in the recipe: instead of being too dense and chewy, by using maida I risk making the bread too crumbly. 
Can I split the difference? Since maida is around 7.5% gluten and the bread flour I'm using (King Arthur) about 12.5% gluten, if I use 50-50 maida and bread flour, I would get a flour with (7.5 + 12.5) / 2 = 10% gluten. That is within the range of AP flour, which could be from 9% to 12% according to that Cooking for Engineers article. 
It seems to me that I could just combine maida and bread flour in equal proportions and use it, not just in this banana bread recipe, but in any recipe that calls for AP flour. Is this understanding sound? Or are there risks I'm not seeing in this approach? Are there specific properties other than the gluten/protein content of maida, bread flour, and AP flour that would cause the recipes to turn out badly?

Can I substitute bread flour for AP flour in banana bread recipe?,"I have bread flour (King Arthur) at home all the time, but I don't usually have all-purpose flour, as bread is pretty much the only thing I bake from scratch. I want to make basic banana bread following this recipe. I have never made banana bread before. 
Can I substitute bread flour for the all-purpose flour? I also have stone-ground whole-wheat flour that I use for chapatis. Would some mixture of whole-wheat and bread flour be a better substitute? The reviews for the banana bread recipe say that it results in a dense loaf, so would using bread flour make it even more dense and thereby unappetizing? 
I don't particularly want to keep all-purpose flour on hand in addition to bread flour and whole wheat flour, as my pantry has tons of flours already; ten at last count. I searched online and on this site but the questions typically seem to be about subbing AP flour for bread flour, or using some other flour instead of wheat flour. I was unable to find anything specifically about using bread flour instead of AP flour. 

Update I decided to risk replacing 1/3 cup of the bread flour with rice flour. I thought that since rice flour is lighter and has no gluten, it would offset the increased denseness caused by using a high-gluten flour. The banana bread turned out fine. 
I have posted a follow-up question about using maida in combination with bread flour to create an all-purpose flour substitute.

Fish always giving bitter/unpleasent taste/smell,"When I make fish in a soup(no ingredients, just water, salt and fish) I notice the soup water tastes bitter/unpleasent and I stop eating it.  This can happen with any fish - it's the same taste and smell.
Sometimes when I cook whitebait from from frozen(which was apparently frozen at sea) that too can get this nasty smell.  I've recently been buying line caught mackeral which isnt old and it doesnt usually have the same problem(above smell and taste doesn't occur), note I usually eat it within 2-3 days.  However the other day on the second day I boiled the mackerel for a while and the same stink and taste happened.  I imagine the prolonged boiling caused the issue to prop up.  On the 3rd day from the same batch of mackerel I didnt overcook the mackeral and the smell didnt come.  This tells me it may be something in the way i'm cooking which is causing the issue.

Is it necessary to rinse Chinese or other tea before first brew / steep / infusion?,"I've been told that I should be rinsing Chinese tea with the boiled water before the first full infusion intended for drinking.
I make the occasional very-expensive tea from Taiwan and I feel it is a waste to throw away a first pot simply for ""rinsing"".  However, my mother-in-law insists it is correct to rinse the tea first :-)
Is this practice of rinsing always advisable, or are there specific cases or kinds of tea where rinsing is necessary? What are we trying to rinse away?  Is the practice only for Chinese tea, or for other kinds of tea as well?
Looking for some enlightenment from some tea experts.  Thank you!

Update:
Since I asked the question, my mother-in-law came across a newspaper article, in Chinese, describing pesticides found on some teas from China, and so it is advisable to rinse before consuming.
Here's a scan I made of the article:

Something in English...
Essentially, the article references a 2012 report by Greenpeace.  You can read a press release about the report, and here's a link to the report itself: Pesticides: Hidden Ingredients in Chinese Tea Report (PDF).  Press release summary:

A Greenpeace investigation has found pesticides banned for use on tea
  in the products marketed by some of China's top tea companies. Some of
  the firms, which include China Tea, Tenfu Tea and China Tea King,
  export tea products to Japan, the US and Europe.

For that reason, I accepted the answer below which suggests rinsing for reduction of pesticides.
Of course, I don't think I'd want to drink a tea with 17 kinds of pesticides present, even if rinsed!  Caveat emptor ... I plan to ask more questions when I buy my tea.

Replacement for alliums?,"I am going to be cooking for someone who, because of Crohn's disease, is unable to eat pretty much anything from the allium family (ie. onions, garlic, shallots, chives, scallions and leeks; this includes garlic and onion powder), as well as spicy food (so that excludes chilis and piquant spices). I have seen Substitute for onions and garlic but because the suggestions there are pretty much other alliums, it is not very helpful for my purposes.
Because onions tends to be in a lot of things (if nothing else, as half of a mirepoix, which tends to appear in many recipes, and is also the base of stocks, which makes things complicated -- I am not 100% sure if the two degrees of separation from onion to stock to whatever the stock is used for is enough to make it ""safe"", and unfortunately I won't have time to make an onion-less stock), I am not really sure what I can use instead.
I realize that it might be hard to substitute onions and garlic with other similar tasting ingredients without using other alliums, so instead, I am looking for suggestions to replace onions and garlic with things that will still let me cook flavourful food (that doesn't necessarily need to taste the same as it would with alliums, though). 
For example, I was thinking about roasting a chicken and making a couscous dressing, but the chicken would sit on mirepoix (can I replace the onions in it with something else?) which would be used as a base for the sauce as well; and my couscous dressing recipe uses shallots (as well as sage, thyme, oregano and pine nuts). General suggestions would be useful as well, though.

"Pre-Cooking Steak in a bag, Any suggestions?","I tried something on the weekend, and it seemed to work well, so I thought I'd ask for comments.
We'd planned to make steak for dinner, and it happened to come in a vacuum-packet plastic. So before opening the bag I dropped it into some hot water (about 170F) for a couple hours. The temp obviously fluctuated a bit, but I topped it off with hot water from time to time.
I like my steak ""lightly seared"", so pretty much ""blue"". So out the bag, into a bit of oil, then into the (very hot) pan. Maybe 60 seconds each side (probably not even that much). Out. Rested. Eat.
It was very soft - and perhaps predictably ""warm through"" - which was different as ""blue"" can end up being quite cold. Was very tender though.
So to my question - any suggested improvements on the technique? Would it benefit to keep the steak in the water longer? (I'm thinking of trying a 24 hour period next). 
One down side is that marinading of the meat (in the bag) isn't possible - so good quality meat with good flavor is a must.

How to Sous Vide Chicken Wings?,"Please refer to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrKHgNXsTYU.
I'd like to mimic the process, but replace the pressure cooker step with a sous vide instead. What's the lowest possible temperature and shortest amount of time I can use the sous vide such that I can chill the wings after the sous vide process and then fry them at high temperature for just 2.5 minutes?
I've done some research on the net for various recipes. One said to set it at 82C for 1.5 hours. I tried that, but the wings' weight dropped by about 30% and separation of the meat from the bone was evident. I don't want the wings to shrink that much. Nor do I want the meat separating from the bone before it gets to the frying stage.
Chicken is supposedly safe to eat at around 74C. Should I set my sous vide to that temperature instead? That way I'll know they are fully cooked even before the wings go into the fryer. If so, what is the minimum amount of time I should put the wings in a 74C bath? I'd like to keep them in there for an absolute minimum to prevent loss of weight and meat separating from the bone?
Or is there a lower temperature I can sous vide the wings at? The rationale being that I will still be frying the wings and perhaps the oil can fully cook it 2.5 minutes. I'm concerned it might not cook fully, especially if the wings are first chilled in the fridge.

What is queso (the sauce/dip)? Is it short for Chile con Queso?,"Queso is the Spanish word for cheese but (in the US) it is often used to refer to a cheese-based dip or sauce for tortilla chips. 
When I google ""what is queso?"", Google says ""short for chile con queso"". Looking it up on Wikipedia leads to a disambiguation page where the page for Chile con Queso looks like the relevant result. That page says chile con queso is ""sometimes described simply as queso"".
However I'm also finding a lot of people who think that it is just a cheese sauce that doesn't have anything to do with chile. 
So is queso short for chile con queso or are they distinct dishes?

Coffee in a rattlesnake recipe? Why?,"WARNING - IF YOU HAVE A PET SNAKE LOOK AWAY NOW!
The quest continues!  The back story to this question is:  My friend is competing in a competition, the main ingredient should be lizard, however I pointed out to her that some people didn't like talking about lizard.  I suggested snake, yes, she can cook snake, and be judged on that, as there will be other snake dishes being offered.  
Now, I've eaten snake, and found it quite palatable, but I have never personally cooked one.  
I asked what equipment they will have access to: BBQ grill, oven, broiler, hot plate for pans. I asked if there were any other requirements as per the ingredients - no she can use what ever she like.
I found this recipe for fried rattlesnake with ham gravy particularly interesting, but am struggling with the coffee bit in it.  Not quite sure why it calls for that, and to my mind sounds wrong - so the question is:  what can she substitute for coffee in this recipe and what does the coffee achieve?

Why are my sous vide salmon fillets coming out raw in the center?,"My wife and I have tried a couple times to sous vide salmon fillets and they seem to keep coming out undercooked or raw in the center and I'm really not sure why.  I took pretty good notes on what we did tonight and I'm hoping someone can find the flaw in my strategy.
We purchased 1 lbs. of salmon fillet from Trader Joe's.  At home, we pulled it out of the refrigerator and cut the skin off of the salmon and cut it into two separate fillets.  I have a FoodSaver vacuum-sealer that I used to vacuum seal the two salmon fillets into a single bag.  The salmon fillets were vacuum-sealed in the same bag, but were not touching on another (they were about 3 inches apart).
I have an Anova Culinary sous vide that I used to get a water bath up to 126 degrees farenheit in a large All-Clad stainless steel pot.  Image of the sous vide setup below:

Once the sous vide was up to temperature at 126 degrees Farenheit, I dropped the vacuum-sealed-bag with the two salmon fillets into the pot and started a timer.  To be on the safe side, I left the salmon in the pot with the temperature at 126 Farenheit for one hour.
When I took the salmon out of the pot and opened the vacuum-sealed bag, it seemed like it was colder than I would expect.  Upon cutting into the salmon, I noticed that it was still raw in the center.
After I noticed the salmon was raw, I put a thermometer in the pot and verified that the temperature was 126 degrees Farenheit, so I think the sous vide is working properly.  From what I've read online, cooking for 1 hour at 126F should be more than enough.  Likewise I read that vacuum-sealing fish tends to end up with overcooked fish rather than undercooked so I didn't think that was the issue.
Where did I go wrong here?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you!

I've only ever used ovens that have a broiler drawer and thought in-oven broilers were reserved for electric or in-wall ovens. One thing I'm really curious about: the broiler burners are the main burners for the oven with broiler drawers. When using an in oven broiler, is the top broiler burner also the main burner for the oven? That would put the flame directly in the oven when baking. Or are there two burners? One underneath for baking and one on top for broiling?

Blue/green mold on sourdough starter,"I have been following instructions from KAF to start my own sourdough. On day 3, some small patches of blue/green mold appeared on the surface. The starter was fairly since the last feeding, increasing in volume about 30% or so. I carefully scooped off the moldy bits and went ahead with the next feeding.
So my question: is it safe to continue with this batch? In addition to the mold, it definitely smelled a bit tangy/funky. However, I've never worked with starter before, so I'm not sure what it's supposed to smell like at this point.

Issue starting a sourdough starter,"I'm making my second attempt at a sourdough starter. I tried once in the past and I now know that I just didn't stick with it long enough and had a bad bread recipe, but with a little more knowledge, I've had the urge to give it another try.
I came across a tutorial when browsing instructables.com, by user name ItsJeremy. He uses half AP flour and half of another flour, but said you can use straight AP. That's what I had, so that's what I used. I spaced out on the very first start up. Instead of using a 2:1 ratio, I used a 1:1, but since many other people use this, I figured it was okay. I went to the 2:1 every 12 hours after that. If my starter got too thick, I'd add a little extra water and if it got a little thin, I'd add a some extra flour. I tried to keep it pancake batter consistency. 
After a couple of days, I started seeing bubbles forming. Not like you'd expect of a good starter, but it was a start. I started it on Sat morning and on Monday, I had made it a little thicker that day and when I got home from work, it had risen about 1/4"". That wasn't much as in the container I had it in, the starter had begun at ~1"" deep. So I got a 25% rise.
However, the next feeding haven't risen at all as far as I can tell. I'm still getting some bubbles, but not a massive amount. I haven't tasted it, but I have been smelling it and I don't smell an odors besides flour and water. Now, at 4 days into it and 7 feedings, I'd expect more progress. We do have the AC on in the house, but I imagine daytime temps are around 75deg. Nighttime probably gets cooler. 
I do live in the south east and temps are hot and humid. I don't know that I shouldn't stick it on the covered front porch in the shade. I have a couple of extra containers and I might try that as well as another I saw a chef on youtube.com do, where they did a 1:1 ratio, put plastic wrap on it and let it sit 24-36 hours with no feedings till it bubbled.
I'm just looking for some guidance here. Is it not taking, do I just need to keep with it, should I find somewhere warmer. I mean I'd at least expect some sour smell after 4 days. It's not like I'm adding bleach instead of water. Thanks for the help.

Why is my sourdough too sweet?,"I’ve been feeding my 40g sourdough starter with 40g water and around 45g wholemeal flour (for a firmer consistency, as I’ve had bad experience with liquid accumulating on top) each day. It initially started smelling quite acidic and yeasty and started bubbling nicely.
From what I had read online, I was afraid that my first bread would be way too sour. But in fact the opposite was the case: after a few days, my starter stopped smelling sour altogether and started smelling almost unbearably fruity-sweet instead. The starter was still good however, so I made bread from it, using a variation of the beginner’s sourdough bread from The perfect loaf. The bread came out alright but rather than tasting sour, it tasted fairly sweet.
I don’t mind the taste that much but I’m still wondering what’s causing my nicely active sourdough to smell and taste distinctly sweet and not the least bit sour. From what I’ve read, the opposite should be the case: my firm sourdough should be more acidic.
For reference, the sourdough jar is standing next to a radiator but my house isn’t heated during the working hours, nor between midnight and 7am, and will get down to 16 °C. To compensate, I’ve wrapped a kitchen towel around the jar.

Are cockroaches a usable source of protein?,"Bear with me, this is an entirely serious if not necessarily particularly practical question :)
In The Damage Done, perhaps the best known notionally non-fiction Thai prison story (and, apparently, soon to be a movie), there are a lot of disgusting, gruesome and/or on occasion quite implausible stories, like elephants playing soccer using balls with prisoners inside.
One of these stories involves our hapless protagonist being thrown into ""the hole"" (isolation) for months, with only water and spoiled rice to eat.  According to the book, he survived because he was taught by Thai prisoners sharing the same fate to trap the plentiful cockroaches, feed the rice to them and then eat the cockroaches (yum yum!), which apparently also served as a source of protein.  Would this actually work?  More specifically, can cockroaches (or insects in general) convert a simple starch into protein, and would you get sick eating them?

Rinsing it under the highest pressure water my sink has doesn't blow away the food matter either, it's just all snagged there pretty tightly.
I found this page about graters and the author there seems to just avoid that side of the grater specifically because of how hard it is to clean, so perhaps there is no hope here.

""Simmer"" means ""low or off position,"" suggesting basically no heat at all.
To ""simmer"" is to heat to a temperature point just off boiling, generally acknowledged as somewhere around 95 degrees C or something like 195 degrees F. 
""Simmer"" is something like a ""soft boil,"" a vague state that appears to be between ""not bubbling"" and ""roiling"", but which by definition must boil in some way, since you know, it's bubbling.

Each of these examples mean fundamentally different things. As far as I can tell, a ""simmer"" is a phase transition whereby the suspension in question, whatever the soup, sauce, or solid (apparently you ""simmer"" bratwurst, you never boil it) may be, cooks in a way that only years of experience or training can identify. Hence, my question:  
What does ""simmer"" mean? Does it differ per recipe or is it universally defined?

Making hard cheese from milk by vinegar,"I tried to make hard cheese from raw milk by a common recipe: heating milk to about 190 F, then adding vinegar to curdle. However, I faced three issues:

Different recipes suggest 1/4 - 1/8 cup of vinegar for one gallon of milk, but in my case, the milk does not curdle with less than 1/2 cup for a gallon of milk.
The cheese produced is very soft. When I try to squeeze the cheesecloth (even think and double layer), the cheese is coming out of the cheesecloth pores. Then, I cannot remove more water from the cheese to make hard cheese.
When I separate the whey, it still contains cheese, and after heating the whey, it produces a lots of cheese (even more than the first step).

Is there anything wrong with my method? 
The cheese produced is quite good, and I just cannot go further to make hard cheese. A possible source of problem can be the size of my curds in the milk suspension, which is smaller than those shown in the vidoes posted on the internet (not forming big lumps; but I have no idea what can be the reason.

"Cooking beef goulash in a slow cooker with a temperature controller, what temperature?","I bought a slow cooker:

and connected it to a temperature controller:

Usually precise temperature control is employed in sous-vide, but I don't want to cook food in plastic bags, only I want to adopt to precise temperature control for making the perfect tender goulash out of cheap goulash beef meat (which can be almost any part of beef which is not nice enough to be sold as a prime part).
I am not going to sear the meat, because of AGEs concern.
So I am cutting the meat into pieces, putting in the slow cooker with vegetables (little or no liquid, the meat and vegetables is gonna give off plenty of its own), and then sticking the temperature controller probe into a piece of meat through a small hole in the lid.
Now I am wondering what temperature and time would be ideal for this exercise? I know I will need to experiment myself, but maybe someone already did this, and if not, at least what values to start experimenting not to have to many failed dinners, and also not have to wait unnecessarily long.
I can probably set it to 65°C (150°F) and wait 3 days, but is it likely to produce a better goulash then some higher temperature at which it will be done in 8 hours? There is probably some point in decreasing temperature and increasing time at which the improvement is infinitesimal or even negative.
Bear in mind in there there are also vegetables like carrots, celery root, parsley root, leeks, radish, swede/rutabaga, and I would prefer them not to be completely unrecognizable.

The question is, given the choice of Anaheim, poblano and jalapeno peppers would it matter to the flavor which pepper I allow to be the source of the heat?

what makes red tomato sauce turn orange in colour?,"I have noticed that tomato sauce (having started with deep red tomatoes) can turn orange.

Blended using a blender or an immersion blender (boat motor).  The colour change is noticeable quickly (30 seconds or so)
Cooked tomato sauce for a long time (hours)

The sauce stays nice and red if taken off the heat quickly and not blended.
Some of the ideas are:

Oxidization: the immersion blender doesn't incorporate much air so this is unlikely.
pH change: this usually requires adding of other items such as vinegar.
Breakdown of seeds or something else in the tomatoes releasing something that causes the change in colour.  Although I think I've seen seedless tomato sauce also go orange.

How to make 'proper' Caribbean Roti,"Having been around the Caribbean a few times I got used to eating Roti from street vendors.  Normally young guys and girls who would make them at home, put them into an insulated box and sell them on the street for a few dollars (ec).  The wrapper that these delicious and filling snacks is what makes them so fantastic.  Light, and almost translucent, they somehow manage to contain the spicy/curried contents even whilst the eater devours it.  Now, we can argue about what is truly a Roti, flat beads etc...  but I am not interested in that, I want to know how (and what type of flour to use) to make the covering for what is considered to be a Caribbean Roti.  PS:  The best ones always seem to come from Grenada.

"Making a dark, suspended chocolate sauce","I melted some dark chocolate at a low temperature and added whipping cream to keep it liquid at room temperature. I added more whipping cream after the mixture was at room temperature, but it thickened the mixture, rather than thinning it. It also reduced how dark the chocolate was to a large degree.
I understand the fat in the milk/cream helps to keep the solid chocolate particles in suspension to keep it from settling.
My goal is to make a very dark chocolate sauce at room temperature in which the solid chocolate particles remain suspended, and I would prefer also to not use starches or gums as they change the flavor. I would also like the consistency to be ""squirtable,"" but a maybe a little thicker than Hershey's syrup. I also don't want a sweet sauce.
My questions are these: 1. Why did the sauce thicken instead of thin and 2. What means should I use to achieve the goals of the sauce and 3. If I reduce the fat content of the liquefier by using milk or water, does it reduce the suspension qualities?

The one thing I always do is wash my stainless steel with warm soapy water and a soft sponge. If there's burned food stuck on the cookware, I scrape it off with a wood pot scraper (lightly, of course). And I always dry with a soft cloth immediately after washing. Yet I still get stains!

Ingredient Identification: Hong Kong restaurant spicy spice,"I was at a fast food restaurant in Hong Kong which was apparently popular for its spicy dishes - there were cartoons on the walls and lots of red peppers everywhere.  It looked like a chain, sort of on the level of In-N-Out or Five Guys, but with spicy ramen.  My wife and I ordered different dishes and they both were, well, spicy.
But! This spicy-ness was a different sensation than I've had before or since, and I can't find what was causing it!  The best way I can explain it is lots of little ants with hot feet running around on my palate.  This isn't very appetizing, I realize, but it was delicious - usually, hot foods will spread out evenly around one's palate, but this was (I'll try again) like those ""pinhead"" toys where each bit of hotness was a separate point (rain on a tin roof?)

Are there food safety issues at a teppan restaurant?,"My family & I recently went out to a teppanyaki restaurant. The food was great and we had no issues with food poisoning, but it got me wondering about their food safety.
The chef cooked everything (seafood, vegetables, fried rice, and chicken) on a large griddle. During the cooking, the chef pull a knife out of a holder on his belt, and chopped the various ingredients in place, on the griddle. He did this numerous times, including with the chicken he was grilling. It seems like he chopped partially cooked chicken (still very pink - looked mostly raw to me) and then used the same knife to chop other ingredients. How is that not a food safety concern?
To be fair, we have eaten at the same restaurant many times, it has passed inspection by the county environmental health office (and the certificate was posted, as required).

How fast can one whip cream?,"Let's say I whip a bowl of cream manually at a slow paced ~3-4 beats per second. The cream would be ready whipped after say 10-15 minutes.
Then I whip an identical bowl of cream at a faster pace of around 6-8 beats per second. The cream would be ready quicker, maybe in 3-5 minutes.
Does this mean if I whip the same bowl of cream with 100 beats per second, it would almost instantly turn into whipped cream? (maybe butter, but let's leave that out of the equation).
I guess it boils down to a somewhat obscured question about the chemistry and mechanics behind the cream whipping, which governs how fast cream turns into whipped cream.

I'm using my iSi cream whipper for the first time, charging it as instructed out of sweat-deserving fear of pressurized items

Some differences:

the contents of the whipper are blended pressure-cooked beans whipped with 35% whipping cream + 3 iSi cartridges
when I charged the cartridges, leakage happened around the charge holder and some of the bean preparation leaked from around the device head
I later discovered that, after cleaning, I didn't reinsert the head gasket (but I'm not certain whether the valve and the perimeter of the head device head are blocked or not due to the potentially-drying bean contents)

Whipping-cream will not stay hard or keep its peaks and gets runny,"My mother is confounded by whipping-cream. Some 20 years ago she started making cream-puffs which quickly became her pastry calling card. They always came out great and were always a hit. Some 15 years later, she cannot seem to make whipped-cream anymore.
She still uses the same bowl, same mixer, same whipping-cream (Nutriwhip whipping-cream) and does everything the same way as she used to, but no matter what, the cream stays soft and will not stiffen or form peaks. (The kitchen is not too hot.)
Some explanations that we have considered include:

Changes to the quality/ingredients of the cream (despite the box being the same)
Adding powdered sugar to the liquid cream before whipping (like she always used to do)
Refrigerator not cold enough (but then, freezer not cold enough either?)
Whipping for too long causes heat build-up due to friction, which melts it (doesn’t excessive beating turn it into butter?)

She tried using different bowl, a chilled bowl, a different mixer, (even made me try by hand once!) She has tried a different brands of cream (35% Beatrice and Lactancia whipping-creams), but gets the same results. One time, I tried adding the powdered sugar after whipping the cream, and it was much better than what she normally gets now, but still not as stiff as compared to the past. Using a whisk on the mixer in place of the normal beaters (which was what she always used before, as my and my sister’s tongues can attest to), seems to help, but even that is only temporary.
She has even tried putting the whipped cream in the freezer, and while it does harden, once it has thawed enough to pipe, it gets runny very quickly (in the past, she would be able to pipe the cream onto baked goods, leave them in the fridge for a day, then drive them to somewhere else without the cream’s edges softening).
She is baffled because she had made whipped-cream for various baked-goods countless times, but until a few years ago, she never had any problems, then suddenly, it never works anymore. I found a few related questions here, but they don’t quite apply (they talk about different bowls, different temperatures, etc., but like I said, it used to work).

What is the most efficient way to prepare (very small) fresh oregano leaves?,"While making my manicotti tonight, I received a painful reminder that the stuffing isn't actually the most tedious part of the process - it's pulling all the tiny leaves off the oregano stems.  It seems as though the oregano I'm able to buy here is not fully grown; it's been like this for as long as I can remember.

Obviously the stems are stiff, and bitter, and generally no good to throw in the mix, at least not with any of the recipes I use.  So I really need to get the leaves off the stems, and with this oregano, it's a painful process.
I've tried obvious routes, like ""stripping"" the leaves off the stems with my hands or a knife, but it doesn't really work.  The stems are too hardy, and if I strip them hard enough to get the leaves off then I usually end up stripping the stem with it.  And laying the stems flat on a cutting board and trying to chop the leaves off directly is almost impossible; the leaves are so tiny and irregularly distributed that it ends up taking longer than just pulling the things apart with my hands.
Am I missing something obvious?  Is there a way to prepare these oregano leaves that's more fun than watching paint dry?

What happens to an acorn squash when its skin turns orange?,"I purchased an acorn squash at the farmer's market quite a while ago and its skin was initially dark green with a small patch of orange.

Can I / should I keep spices & dried herbs in the fridge?,"Common wisdom regarding spice storage (whether whole or ground) seems to tend towards cool, dark, dry places. However, I'm somewhat limited on kitchen cupboard space, and obviously the various spice rack options available don't do a great job on the ""dark"" front, and in my kitchen not on the ""cool"" front either.
Is it OK (both taste-wise and food safety-wise) for me to keep my spices in the fridge? I typically keep them either in the small glass jar I buy them in, or (when bought in a packet) in resealable tupperware-style containers, all in one of the crisper drawers (mainly because I don't typically fill both).
Whatever the answer, does it apply to dried herbs also?

How to easily minimize waste using a potato smasher?,"I have a new tool. At Walmart they didn't seem to have the kind of potato masher I'm used to, so I bought this thing.

(The can of soup is there for size reference.§) From a young age I'm used to the tool with a long stiff steel wire extending out of the handle about 3"", zig-zagging on itself several times in a flat plane, then returning back to the handle. Since that thing mashed, and this thing smashes, I call it a potato smasher.
I had not yet cleaned up, so you can see some mashed potato in a few of the holes. Therein lies my problem. As I smashed the boiled potatos, potato would extrude through all the holes.  It was easy to remove potato from top and bottom for multiple mashes -- just wipe it off with a fork.  But with 24 little holes, I did not know how to efficiently remove the contents of the holes and return it to the smashing bowl when done.  Is there an easy way to remove potato from all the holes without waste?
In the end, after I was done smashing, I cheated. Using my mouth, I just sucked out as much potato as I could. It was good! Even with my big mouth, I could not get it all, though.
§ I lied, sort of.  The can is also there because that was our gravy.  We lacked normal gravy ingredients, so I got some help from Necessity's kid. Using heated split pea soup as gravy ended up tasting great. More vegetables, plus the ham in the soup provided a bit of meat. (I'm not pushing the Progresso brand; it is just what we happened to have.)

Irish Coffee harder to get right than Baileys Coffee?,"On a cold winter's day I was in a Irish-themed pub/restaurant and ordered an Irish Coffee. Some time later (could have been half an hour or longer), the waitress comes with all the stuff other people at the table ordered but she was terribly sorry to tell me that me that the person possessing the abilities to create this particular mix drink was currently not here and she asked whether I wouldn't want a different hot drink instead. Now, from my recollection the only other hot (alcoholic) drink on the menu would have been Baileys Coffee and I thought that surely the same would apply here and I opted for something cold instead, she asked me then explicitly whether I wouldn't want another hot drink but I reiterated my new choice.
Now in hindsight I can't stop thinking about whether I was right in my assumption that if Irish Coffee was not possible Baileys Coffee wouldn't be either. That's assuming it's the same only with Baileys instead of good whiskey (which would explain why latter was also cheaper). The thoughts even made me read up a bit on creating either drink and indeed in Irish Coffee recipes in particular it was often mentioned that getting the cream to float can be a tad tricky but I didn't get any clear answer.
So therefore I'm asking here:
Is Irish Coffee significantly harder to get right compared to Baileys Coffee?

Secrets to making crystal clear gelatin?,"As I've mentioned in another question, I'm attempting to make a large block of gelatin.  Unfortunately, my first few attempts come out a bit amber in hue, using just water, sugar, gelatin and clear flavoring.

used a different brand of gelatin

So on day 3 my starter has gone crazy doubling or even more in size and shrinking again by the time the 24 hour period is up. Next step is where my starter dies every time, I discard half and add another 100g of flour and 100g of water.

A little more info - I got the idea from my well used copy of Lynne Rosetto Kasper's ""The Italian Country Table"" where in several recipes a small amount of pasta water is reserved for deglazing or cooking down within a vegetable dish. So, that's been my usage. 
Consensus seems to be that it's not worth the effort to save for later.

I leave it for a few minutes (med high heat) and then flip it. At that point, I added in a tab of butter, a crushed garlic clove, and some fresh herbs. As the butter melted I basted the fish.

"Creating a home ""anti-griddle""?","I watched a restaurant documentary last night (Spinning Plates; pretty good!) which featured a modernist chef demonstrating their kitchen's anti-griddle: essentially a large metal plate chilled down to somewhere around -40 degrees (both F and C, oddly enough).  It's used to chill and freeze foods that can't be frozen at normal freezer temperatures like olive oil, a bit like dipping or dropping into liquid nitrogen.  I've never been much of a fan of molecular gastronomy, but I was absolutely fascinated by this idea, as I'd never seen anything like it before.  I'm compelled to give it a try.
The official, professional version of this machine runs about $1200 USD, so that's completely out.  These guys created one using a cast-iron skillet submerged in liquid nitrogen, but I'm not buying a massive container of that either.  This site suggests that similar results can be had at home by placing a sheet pan on top of a block of dry ice, which sounds more reasonable, at least from a financial perspective.  I obtained an estimate for a 10-inch x 10-inch x 2-inch slab of dry ice (about 10 lbs) for $15 USD.  EDIT: Responses to date also suggest using a bed of dry ice chips.  I'm checking to see if there's a significant price difference, as I'll probably be trying the cheapest method for my first go.
However, before I embark on what sounds like a chemistry lab demonstration in my kitchen, I thought it best to seek some advice.  Specifically:

Has anyone actually tried this at home with any success?  You'll get automatic bonus points for being braver than I.
Are there particular hazards that I need to be aware of during this exercise in applied insanity?  Let's assume that I can guess at some obvious ones like ""Don't touch the dry ice with your hands"" and ""Let the frozen items warm up a little before you eat them"".
Would a slab the size of the one described above last long enough to let me experiment a bit, or would it simply sublimate down to a useless size within a matter of minutes? 
If anyone's actually worked with a professional-grade anti-griddle before, would a home hack like this produce similar results, or am I just fooling myself?

I look forward to any input that I can get, because I'm really excited by the novelty of this idea!  Feel free to completely dash my hopes.
EDIT: Great suggestions so far, thanks all!  I'm keeping this open for now since I haven't seen any definitive answers based on experience with this method, and I'll add my own answer once I can give it a try.

AB: So it's okay to put your hands on the chicken and then stick em back in the salt. Okay, also noted. Good sanitation procedures.
JKLA: What's going to live in the salt?
AB: Nothing's going to live in the salt at all. I'm just giving you crap.

Is it true that nothing is going to live in the salt? Practically, how likely is it for salt to become unsafe for consumption through unsafe sanitation procedures?
As far as I know, there are organisms which can thrive in saline environments, but extreme halophiles are found in solutions of 20 to 25% salinity, not crystalline NaCl. Would mold be a concern? Perhaps the amount of time between contamination and use would make a difference? Does it matter if the salt is granular or in a solid block?

Can I salvage undercooked flan,"I nearly doubled a flan recipe and didn't cook it enough, and so now it's not set. It's been in my fridge for about 18 hours. 
Do you think I can put it back in the oven for 20-30 minutes or so?
Original recipe was 45 minutes, I did 55, which I now realize was too short. 
I guess it's edible now as a kind of gloopy pudding. If I can't recook, any ideas on what I could do with it?

"Botulism, Garlic, Cold pressed Olive oil and mason jars","I make a product I invented called Maybe It's Marinade. Cold pressed extra virgin olive olive, pressed garlic as the base in three varieties, AoliOliO, Dill and Cayenne Pepper, garlic powder, and titch of salt. I package it in a 250 ml mason jar. I also place the jar in a celephane bag as part of its packaging. Recently, a public inspector noticed the product and sunk his teeth into it concerning Botulism risks. 
I've been making this for eighteen years. No one has ever gotten sick. I designed the product to be stored in the cupboard. Using cold pressed olive, extra virgin olive oil I have never found the product to become awful, discolored, smelly, and I set some aside in my house on several occassions for months and tested it on myself and found nothing wrong. 
The product is not a method of storing garlic in the oil, with the other ingredients in the recipe, it becomes a bread dipping oil, cooking tool, pasta sauce accessory. 
The use of the mason jar provides a secure lid but a very reusable easy to open situation. I do not fill the oil to the top, so that the product can be shaken. Its a very interactive product if that makes sense, in the way that it's spoon accessible. 
Can you provide some sort of pro and con overview? I only see articles on storing garlic in oil, not as an ingredient in a recipe? If there's a chance i will make people sick afer eighteen years, I may have to stop making it. 
Thanks a heap.

Could you use a bread tin as a pate mould?,"I have bread tins and was wondering if they would work as pate molds? I'm just a little bit worried that they will rust. Also I have seen videos where youtubers line the mold with plastic to get the pate out of the mold easier, is there not a way to use something like ""Cook and Spray"" to stop the pate from sticking. I'm a little bit scared of the plastic melting.

What is 1 scallion?,"When a recipe calls for 1 scallion / green onion / spring onion, what does it mean?
Is it A (a bundle as sold), B (a bunch of connected shoots), or C (one shoot)?

"How long is bread ""Safe"" in the fridge?","Now I know bread shouldn't be kept in the fridge, but I had leftover garlic bread from pizza stored in the fridge for two days.
I warmed it up and ate them (I was really lazy today haha). then I thought....I wonder if those were bad? But since it's bread I figure 2 days shouldn't be that bad.
Then I read about how you should never store bread in the fridge because it will go stale......but stale isn't the same as ""spoiled"" is it technically? I mean it would probably be just hard and tasteless correct?

How can I cook more efficiently in a campervan using a single pot over a gas-powered flame?,"I am using a campervan 3 nights per week, 40 weeks per year.  I have a single gas powered hob (like most camping stoves), a sink with running water and am seeking advice to cook efficiently with as minimal cleaning as possible. 
Caveat: I don't have a fridge/freezer but median temperature in the UK is extremely low (my olive oil froze today! haha)

Can I substitute canola or safflower oil for vegetable oil when making granola?,"I am making granola and just realized I do not have vegetable oil. Can either canola oil or safflower oil be substituted without compromising the flavor?

"Do you heat the pan first, then add oil? Or put the oil in and heat up with the pan?","As the title says...
I personally heat up the pan first, then put the oil in and after it's heated up add the ingredients.  I go with the line of reasoning that doing it this way gives the oil less time to burn, thinking that if you do it the other way, by the time the pan and oil has heated up, the oil could already be starting to burn.
I've never experimented, but I think this is more of an issue with electric stoves since you can modulate the heat more quickly with gas, ie turn it off if the oil's starting to smoke.

"""Acetone"" smell on bread","I sometimes buy a brand of multi-grain salt-free bread *. After 2-3 days, it gets a very distinct smell of acetone, like paint stripper or nail polish remover. If I toast the bread, the smell goes away.
The bread is well within its sell-by date, so I don't typically put it into the fridge. This is not a one-off thing - I've noticed it many times for this type of bread.
I am confused by where acetone would come from in the typical grain/yeast mixture used for bread. What could be causing this? Is the bread still safe to eat?

Potatoes in bread? How to estimate potatoes needed?,"Just found out that adding potato to a bread recipe can make it softer and more moist. I'd like to experiment with this. If I were following a recipe that didn't include potatoes, how could I modify it to include potatoes? Do the potatoes need to be a certain percentage of the flour? Do I add more liquids along with the potato? Do I remove some flour and replace with potatoes?
Also, will potato flakes work as well?

What differences will happen if you use a rectangular baker to bake cookies instead of a tray?,"Hey so I have these rectangular bakers that I use to make lasagna. Unfortunately I don't bake cookies that often so I don't have a standard cookie tray. I decided to bake some cookies though so I opted for using those since those are what I have in my disposal. See below

I just popped them into the oven but I actually didn't consider if this would affect how long they need to cook for since they have that lip that surround the cookies. Will they turn out okay? If I don't get an answer in the next 8 or so minutes I can post what will happen for science.

Why aren't my chocolate chip cookies coming out the way I'd like them?,"I'm making chocolate chip cookies. Am I doing something wrong if my cookies look flat on top, and soft, and brown on the bottom. They're soft on top and are crunchier at the bottom. They taste fully cooked and good, but not exactly like cookies should right? Am I undercooking them or preparing them a wrong way? Or is this normal?
Here's the recipe I used, and the picture that's on the page.
Ingredients:
1 1/4
    cups granulated sugar 
1 1/4
    cups packed brown sugar 
1 1/2
    cups butter or margarine, softened 
2
    teaspoons vanilla 
3
    eggs 
4 1/4
    cups all-purpose flour 
2
    teaspoons baking soda 
1/2
    teaspoon salt 
1
    to 2 bags (12 oz each) semisweet chocolate chips (2 to 4 cups) 
Directions:

Heat oven to 375°F. In large bowl with electric mixer, beat granulated sugar, brown sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Beat in vanilla and eggs until well blended. Beat in flour, baking soda and salt. Stir in chocolate chips.
On ungreased cookie sheets, drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until light golden brown. Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheets to cooling racks.

Kitchenaid mixer dropping metal shavings,"My fiance and I have been using our KitchenAid 600 series pro mixer almost daily for close to 7 months now with no issue.
Today I wanted to surprise my fiance with homemade whole wheat pasta, and followed the KitchenAid recipe exactly. First, the recipe was completely incorrect (needed triple the required water, and two tablespoons of olive oil to get the correct consistency). Using their specified recipe basically left me with sand.
After making the adjustments, I re-ran the dough with the paddle, and then again with the dough hook.
This time both parts occasionally had a hard time with the firmness of the dough. At all times the speed limit of 2 was obeyed from the manual. It DID finish the dough; I hand kneaded for a few minutes, and threw it in the fridge where it is currently sitting.
However, afterwards I noticed small bits of metal shavings on the counter around where the KitchenAid had been sitting. Has anyone encountered this? Do I need to get a replacement (if they'll even honor it since we bought it from the original buyer)? Do I need to get it serviced? I ran the mixer without the bowl for a few minutes just to see if more shavings would fall but none seem to be doing that. Could it be a one time fluke? I'm just trying to find out more about my situation.

Is it okay to keep flour in the freezer?,"Years ago I noticed I was getting little bugs in the flour that I kept in the pantry.  To prevent this, I started keeping my flour in the freezer.  I don't do a lot of baking, but I was wondering what effects this might have on anything I do bake.
Do baked goods turn out any differently when flour is kept in the freezer vs flour kept at room temperature?  Also, if it's okay to freeze flour, how long will it last this way?
